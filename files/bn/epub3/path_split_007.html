<h2 class="subtitle" id="calibre_pb_6">OUR RELIGION CLOAKS OUR DARK GUILT</h2>
	<p class="poem">However, our sinful nature has separated us</p>
	<p class="poem">from our Holy God</p>
	<p class="poem">and, obeying the voice of the Evil One,</p>
	<p class="poem">we ourselves have become evil,</p>
	<p class="poem">though we love to hide our guilt</p>
	<p class="poem">under the cloak of religion.</p>
	<p class="poem">But <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  is not mocked.</p>
	<p class="poem">All things are naked and opened</p>
	<p class="poem">unto the eyes of Him</p>
	<p class="poem">with whom we have to do.</p>
	<p class="poem">He who made the eye,</p>
	<p class="poem">can He not see?</p>
	<p class="poem">And even the scoffers know</p>
	<p class="poem">that we are of our father the devil</p>
	<p class="poem">if the lusts of our father we do.</p>
	<p class="poem">Only the Word of God</p>
	<p class="poem">can speak into our hearts</p>
	<p class="poem">a new creation nature!</p>
	<p class="poem">As long as we place our trust</p>
	<p class="poem">in anything apart from the living Word,</p>
	<p class="poem">that "anything" becomes our real god</p>
	<p class="poem">and we become its slaves.</p>
	<p class="poem">No matter how religiously</p>
	<p class="poem">we observe religious rules and laws,</p>
	<p class="poem">that idol "anything" has usurped</p>
	<p class="poem">the living Word's place in our hearts</p>
	<p class="poem">and will lead us to corruption.</p>
	<p class="poem">Now religious do's and don'ts</p>
	<p class="poem">were the rudimentary guardians</p>
	<p class="poem">of our spiritual childhood, it is true.</p>
	<p class="poem">But the time has come</p>
	<p class="poem">for us to outgrow the tutelage</p>
	<p class="poem">of mere religious formalism</p>
	<p class="poem">and to receive the spiritual adoption</p>
	<p class="poem">of mature heirs.</p>
	<p class="poem">When the living Word</p>
	<p class="poem">takes up residence within us,</p>
	<p class="poem">we receive a filial spirit of obedience;</p>
	<p class="poem">we become the spiritual people of Ibrahim,</p>
	<p class="poem">and God becomes our Father.</p>
	<p class="poem">For God sent his living Word</p>
	<p class="poem">into our hearts to restore us</p>
	<p class="poem">in his likeness and for his fellowship,</p>
	<p class="poem">that we might walk naturally with Him as our Father,</p>
	<p class="poem">and not hobble like aliens under the cold prod of laws.</p>
