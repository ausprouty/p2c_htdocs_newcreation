	<p class="poem"><span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> KNOWS WHERE YOU LIVE</p>
	<p class="poem">and so do Shaitan and the evil jinn (demons).</p>
	<p class="poem">This was proven to a man of God</p>
	<p class="poem">in modern times.</p>
	<p class="poem">This is a true story.</p>
	<h2 class="subtitle">A PRAYER IS MIRACULOUSLY ANSWERED</h2>
	<p class="poem">The man of God was calling out to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> one morning</p>
	<p class="poem">to bring more people to the jami' (congregation).</p>
	<p class="poem">He was on his face before <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">and he was supplicating du'a (free-prayer) very loudly</p>
	<p class="poem">alone in a tiny apartment.</p>
	<p class="poem">This was the only masjid (place of prayer)</p>
	<p class="poem">the people had for their meetings</p>
	<p class="poem">because the godless leaders,</p>
	<p class="poem">more sensitive to politics than to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> ,</p>
	<p class="poem">had thrown the congregation</p>
	<p class="poem">out of a public meeting hall.</p>
	<p class="poem">But praise be to God who hears and answers</p>
	<p class="poem">when we call on Him!</p>
	<p class="poem">There is none like the Lord our God,</p>
	<p class="poem">praise be unto Him.</p>
	<p class="poem">He says somewhere,</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;Before they call I will answer,</p>
	<p class="poem">and while they are yet speaking I will hear.&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">In fact, the request of the man of God</p>
	<p class="poem">had been answered weeks before he made his petition.</p>
	<h2 class="subtitle">HOW GOD HAD BEEN PREPARING TO ANSWER PRAYER</h2>
	<p class="poem">Here is the true story:</p>
	<p class="poem">A young man and his wife</p>
	<p class="poem">had been travelling for several days</p>
	<p class="poem">looking for the man of God.</p>
	<p class="poem"><span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  had led them on a spiritual pilgrimage,</p>
	<p class="poem">for <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  foreknew both the prayer and its answer,</p>
	<p class="poem">which He was now effecting.</p>
	<p class="poem">We will call these two muridun (aspirants)</p>
	<p class="poem">Isha and Ahmad.</p>
	<p class="poem">They had long heard of the spiritual 'ilm (knowledge)</p>
	<p class="poem">of the man of God,</p>
	<p class="poem">though they had never met him personally.</p>
	<p class="poem">And so they went out like Ibrahim (Abraham),</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;who by faith obeyed</p>
	<p class="poem">when he was called to go out to a place</p>
	<p class="poem">which he was to receive as an inheritance;</p>
	<p class="poem">and he went out,</p>
	<p class="poem">not knowing where he was to go.&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">Like Ibrahim, the man and wife wanted to seek</p>
	<p class="poem">the straight path,</p>
	<p class="poem">the path of the just,</p>
	<p class="poem">and they sought to do this under the huda (guidance)</p>
	<p class="poem">of the man of God.</p>
	<p class="poem">The man and woman wanted to submit their lives to <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">and find the path of life in His Word,</p>
	<p class="poem">as it says,</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;Make me to go in the path of thy commandments,</p>
	<p class="poem">for therein do I delight.&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">However, Isha and Ahmad did not know in which village</p>
	<p class="poem">the man of God lived,</p>
	<p class="poem">nor the street location of his dwelling.</p>
	<p class="poem">But praise be to God</p>
	<p class="poem">for it says,</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;Thy word is a lamp unto my feet</p>
	<p class="poem">and a light unto my path.&quot;</p>
	<h2 class="subtitle">THE MIRACLE OCCURS</h2>
	<p class="poem">On the very night before the miracle happened,</p>
	<p class="poem">Ahmad and Isha happened to take a room in a hotel</p>
	<p class="poem">a very short distance from the place</p>
	<p class="poem">where the man of God dwelt.</p>
	<p class="poem">On the very morning</p>
	<p class="poem">when the man of God</p>
	<p class="poem">was petitioning <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  so earnestly to send more people,</p>
	<p class="poem">Isha had taken her baby for a walk</p>
	<p class="poem">and she was going down the street.</p>
	<p class="poem">She was walking along,</p>
	<p class="poem">and when she came to the building</p>
	<p class="poem">where the man of God was on his face</p>
	<p class="poem">crying out to God</p>
	<p class="poem">(even though there was no sign on the building</p>
	<p class="poem">nor any way in the world to know</p>
	<p class="poem">the man of God was inside)</p>
	<p class="poem">Isha stopped and asked a lady passer-by</p>
	<p class="poem">if she knew of any jami' (gathering)</p>
	<p class="poem">for du'a (free-prayer) in the area.</p>
	<p class="poem">The lady passer-by happened to be a murid (novice believer) who</p>
	<p class="poem">belonged to the persecuted flock of God</p>
	<p class="poem">that met in the dwelling of the man of God.</p>
	<p class="poem">Not only that,</p>
	<p class="poem">the women happened,</p>
	<p class="poem">in the providence of God,</p>
	<p class="poem">to pass each other</p>
	<p class="poem">right in front of this very house masjid (place of prayer)!</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;The Lord orders the steps of a righteous person&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">is the saying.</p>
	<p class="poem">Many err with their doctrine</p>
	<p class="poem">knowing neither the Scriptures nor the power of God,</p>
	<p class="poem">nor the love of God, which passes all understanding.</p>
	<p class="poem">What <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  foreknows He forewills</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;to work together for good for those</p>
	<p class="poem">who love <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> , who are called according to his purpose,&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">who are blessed, because they &quot;are not offended at His Word.&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">At this exact moment, then,</p>
	<p class="poem">just as the man of God finished his petition</p>
	<p class="poem">with the words, &quot;Send us more people, Lord&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">--there was a knock on the door!</p>
	<p class="poem">The man of God had no idea who Isha was.</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;Do you know where my husband and I</p>
	<p class="poem">could find a congegation?&quot; Isha asked.</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;Yes,&quot; the man of God said, flabbergasted.</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;Praise to Him,&quot; Isha said,</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;because we've been seeking</p>
	<p class="poem">to find a certain man of God,&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">and then she gave his name.</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;Do you know where I could find him?&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;I'm he,&quot; the man of God said.</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;Oh...&quot; Isha was shocked.</p>
	<p class="poem">So the man of God saw his prayer</p>
	<p class="poem">answered so suddenly and miraculously.</p>
	<p class="poem">God had led the woman to the man of God.</p>
	<p class="poem">Al-Hadi (The Guide) knew where he lived!</p>
	<p class="poem">For Al-Hadi is Al-'Alim (The All-Knowing).</p>
	<p class="poem">Right after that the congregation started to grow again,</p>
	<p class="poem">despite the opposition of the godless.</p>
	<p class="poem">And both Isha and her husband Ahmad</p>
	<p class="poem">submitted to the death ghusl</p>
	<p class="poem">of New Creation Islam in the ocean,</p>
	<p class="poem">calling on <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  to cleanse their inner being</p>
	<p class="poem">with &quot;the wudu (washing) of tajaddud (regeneration)</p>
	<p class="poem">and the renewing of the Eternal Spirit of <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> .&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">That was nearly ten years ago.</p>
	<p class="poem">Then the man of God moved to another place.</p>
	<h2 class="subtitle">YEARS LATER ANOTHER MIRACLE HAPPENS</h2>
	<p class="poem">Would it take a miracle</p>
	<p class="poem">to show you the difference</p>
	<p class="poem">between a true Islamic teacher</p>
	<p class="poem">and a pseudo-Islamic teacher?</p>
	<p class="poem">Very recently Ahmad called the man of God</p>
	<p class="poem">long distance on the telephone to tell him</p>
	<p class="poem">that Isha wanted a divorce.</p>
	<p class="poem">They had been having marriage problems</p>
	<p class="poem">and she had turned to a man for help,</p>
	<p class="poem">a fraud who claimed to be a good murshid (spiritual guide) but</p>
	<p class="poem">who was in reality</p>
	<p class="poem">a pseudo-Islamic shaman</p>
	<p class="poem">trafficking in the realm of spells</p>
	<p class="poem">and charms and sorcery,</p>
	<p class="poem">witchcraft, talismans and familiar spirits,</p>
	<p class="poem">divining, saint worship, and demons,</p>
	<p class="poem">fortune-telling, incantations and the evil eye.</p>
	<p class="poem">It says somewhere,</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;Acquaint now thyself with Him (God)</p>
	<p class="poem">and be at peace;</p>
	<p class="poem">thereby good shall come unto Thee.&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">But some people want to get more acquainted</p>
	<p class="poem">with jinn or demons rather than the Word of <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> ,</p>
	<p class="poem">as it says,</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;My people perish for lack of knowledge of Thy word,</p>
	<p class="poem">for they have rejected the knowledge of thy Word.&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">The haram (forbidden) demon procurer</p>
	<p class="poem">whom Isha consulted</p>
	<p class="poem">promised her peace</p>
	<p class="poem">and even dramatic out-of-the-body psychic experiences;</p>
	<p class="poem">he claimed to offer her direct access</p>
	<p class="poem">to &quot;Spiritual Masters&quot; who make their appearance</p>
	<p class="poem">as &quot;light-being entities.&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">Such counterfeit guides, as this man, are like</p>
	<p class="poem">the devils with whom they commune.</p>
	<p class="poem">They are unclean religious peddlers</p>
	<p class="poem">disguised as servants of <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> .</p>
	<p class="poem">There is nothing unexpected about such frauds</p>
	<p class="poem">if, as it says,</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;Shaitan himself goes disguised as an angel of light</p>
	<p class="poem">seeking whom he may devour.&quot;</p>
	<h2 class="subtitle">THE MAN OF GOD DECIDES TO TEACH ISHA AND AHMAD ABOUT MARRIAGE IN TERMS OF THE KINGDOM</h2>

	<p class="poem">was pulsating with a scarlet light,</p>
	<p class="poem">as brilliant as a strobe light.</p>
	<p class="poem">The room was normally pitch black</p>
	<p class="poem">at three o'clock in the morning</p>
	<p class="poem">but now everything in the room was brightly visible.</p>
	<p class="poem">The man of God stood up</p>
	<p class="poem">to make sure he was awake.</p>
	<p class="poem">The awesome light of this</p>
	<p class="poem">definite supernatural visitation continued.</p>
	<p class="poem">Then the Lord seemed to speak</p>
	<p class="poem">to the man of God in a very still small voice,</p>

	<p class="poem">Cover yourself with the blood of my Word Isa.&quot; <a   id = "R40" class = "note" href = "#N40">40</a></p>
	<p class="poem">The man of God instantly saw the nature</p>
	<p class="poem">of the spiritual struggle:</p>
	<p class="poem">the demon was attacking the man of God</p>
	<p class="poem">because Isha was his property</p>
	<p class="poem">and this devil was protecting his goods.</p>
	<p class="poem">The man of God said these simple words with faith,</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;I cover myself with the blood of Isa.&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">Immediately the pulsating light faded.&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;Resist the Devil,&quot; it says somewhere;</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;overcome him by the confession of your faith in Isa</p>
	<p class="poem">and by the blood of Isa,</p>
	<p class="poem">and he will flee from you.&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">The man of God lay down and closed his eyes.</p>
	<p class="poem">Immediately he saw</p>
	<p class="poem">with the vision given him by the Eternal Spirit of <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">a package in the house of Isha and Ahmad.</p>
	<p class="poem">The indwelling Spirit of God</p>
	<p class="poem">impressed on the mind of the man of God</p>
	<p class="poem">that he should call Ahmad on the telephone right then</p>
	<p class="poem">and tell him to go back into his house,</p>
	<p class="poem">taking dominion over it room by room,</p>
	<p class="poem">covering the realm of his dominion</p>
	<p class="poem">with the blood of the halifa (agent in charge) of <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>,</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa the Word of <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> .</p>
	<p class="poem">It was especially impressed on the man of God</p>

	<p class="poem">and get that horrible package of occult materials</p>

	<p class="poem">or any other wicked thing,</p>
	<p class="poem">whether it was any curse or blessing</p>
	<p class="poem">thought to ward off the evil eye,</p>
	<p class="poem">any practice or object that grieves the Eternal Spirit of<span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>

	<p class="poem">It would be better to enter heaven with nothing</p>

	<p class="poem">in your possession,</p>
	<p class="poem">any demon that is cast out will go and find seven other demons</p>
	<p class="poem">and come back to drag you down to hell.</p>
	<p class="poem">The man of God obeyed the Lord.</p>
	<p class="poem">Even though it was not yet four o'clock in the morning,</p>
	<p class="poem">the man of God called Ahmad and woke him up.</p>
	<p class="poem">The man of God covered him</p>
	<p class="poem">with the blood of the Word of <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">and called out to God, interceding for him on the  telephone.</p>
	<p class="poem">When Ahmad heard what had happened to the man of God</p>
	<p class="poem">he realized that this demon who had taken over his house,</p>
	<p class="poem">who was destroying the peace of his family</p>
	<p class="poem">and unsettling his children,</p>
	<p class="poem">this demon who was oppressing his wife,</p>
	<p class="poem">this same demon was trying to frighten the man of God</p>
	<p class="poem">away from saving their home.</p>
	<p class="poem">Ahmad also promised the man of God</p>
	<p class="poem">that he would not sign the divorce papers</p>
	<p class="poem">that very day as his wife had requested.</p>
	<p class="poem">The admonition is clear:</p>

	<p class="poem">When the man of God saw the package,</p>
	<p class="poem">it was by means of a gift of the Eternal Spirit of <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> ;</p>
	<p class="poem">namely, supernatural &quot;knowledge&quot; <a  id = "R42" class = "note" href = "#N42">42</a></p>

	<p class="poem">Even though Judas sat next to the Word of <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">eating his bread at the Last Supper,</p>
	<p class="poem">all Judas could read were &quot;errors.&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">Judas had frequently heard Jesus say</p>
	<p class="poem">that it was necessary for the Messiah to die</p>
	<p class="poem">as a sacrifice for the sins of the world,</p>
	<p class="poem">but Judas &quot;read&quot; this solemn declaration as an error.</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;The Messiah must be strong to rule us,&quot;</p>

	<p class="poem">His errors will get us all killed, not just himself!&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa had enough love to die for Judas' sins</p>
	<p class="poem">but, like the rest of unregenerate humanity,</p>
	<p class="poem">Judas saw error in this and in everything else</p>

	<p class="poem">Bitter sons of the devil!</p>
	<p class="poem">Black-hearted traitors against God</p>

	<p class="poem">But some fools are even more perverse!</p>
	<p class="poem">Who is more truly a liar</p>

	<p class="poem">the one who was crucified in Isa's place? <a  id = "R47" class = "note" href = "#N47">47</a></p>
	<p class="poem">Such a one will surely go the way of Judas</p>
	<p class="poem">for agreeing with him</p>
	<p class="poem">that God's account of things cannot be trusted.</p>
	<p class="poem">Only a good man like Isa could cry out</p>
	<p class="poem">while hanging on the khashabah (wood) in the agony of death,</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">A traitor like Judas would know the answer to that question!</p>

	<p class="poem">And if like Judas we think ourselves wiser</p>

	<p class="poem">Isa was willing to die that same day for Judas</p>
	<p class="poem">but Judas refused to pick up his cross and die,</p>
	<p class="poem">if necessary, with Isa.</p>
	<p class="poem">Judas saw an error in that.</p>
	<p class="poem">What craftiness this fool had!</p>
	<p class="poem">He saw he could save his own life</p>
	<p class="poem">and even make some money</p>

	<p class="poem">as part of the sufferings to be endured by the Messiah:</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;Yes, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted,</p>
	<p class="poem">which did eat of my bread,</p>
	<p class="poem">hath lifted up his heel against me.&quot;<a  id = "R50" class = "note" href = "#N50">50</a></p>
	<p class="poem">But the Word of <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  who delivered this prophecy to Da'ud</p>
	<p class="poem">a thousand years before it happened</p>
	<p class="poem">also knew that Judas would fulfill it.</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa al-Masih the Word of <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  said,</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;I assure you, one of you will betray me,</p>
	<p class="poem">one who is eating with me.&quot; <a  id = "R51" class = "note" href = "#N51">51</a></p>
	<p class="poem">Over 500 years before this,</p>
	<p class="poem">the Word of <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  had enabled the prophet Zechariah</p>
	<p class="poem">to foresee what God would cause to happen:</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa would be betrayed for thirty pieces of silver; <a  id = "R52" class = "note" href = "#N52">52</a></p>
	<p class="poem">which actually happened</p>
	<p class="poem">when the priests paid Judas that amount of money</p>
	<p class="poem">to purchase unwittingly</p>
	<p class="poem">the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world.</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;I am going to strike the shepherd</p>
	<p class="poem">and the sheep will be scattered,&quot; Zechariah predicted.</p>
	<p class="poem">The Word of <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  had even inspired</p>
	<p class="poem">the prophet Daniel to foresee</p>
	<p class="poem">not only the death of the Messiah</p>
	<p class="poem">but also the subsequent destruction of the Temple:</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;After this period of 434 years, the Messiah will be killed, but</p>
	<p class="poem">not for himself, and the people of the prince that shall come</p>
	<p class="poem">shall destroy the city and the sanctuary.&quot; <a  id = "R53" class = "note" href = "#N53">53</a></p>
	<p class="poem">The manner of the Messiah 's atoning death</p>
	<p class="poem">which will not be &quot;for himself&quot; <a  id = "R54" class = "note" href = "#N54">54</a></p>
	<p class="poem">but for the sins of the whole world</p>
	<p class="poem">is clearly described in the Zabur (Psalms):</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;They pierced my hands and feet.&quot; <a  id = "R55" class = "note" href = "#N55">55</a></p>
	<p class="poem">But Judas had no taste for the word of God.</p>
	<p class="poem">He did not treasure these words in his heart.</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa warned that man cannot live by bread alone</p>
	<p class="poem">but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.</p>
	<p class="poem">Yet Judas thought he could mock the grace of the Lord</p>
	<p class="poem">and lie to the Eternal Spirit of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> .</p>
	<p class="poem">Judas fooled only himself.</p>
	<p class="poem">The Word of God could read the traitor's inmost thoughts.</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa didn't need anyone to tell him what was in a man.</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa knew what Judas would do.</p>
	<p class="poem">He allowed him to do it</p>
	<p class="poem">so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled.</p>
	<p class="poem">But woe to the man who fulfilled them!</p>
	<p class="poem">Judas didn't run far.</p>
	<p class="poem">When all his treachery was over,</p>
	<p class="poem">he found himself totally alone</p>
	<p class="poem">and only Satan wanted his detestable company.</p>
	<p class="poem">So Judas committed suicide.</p>
	<p class="poem">Now he is in hell.</p>
	<p class="poem">How do we know?</p>
	<p class="poem">Because Isa said it would have been better</p>
	<p class="poem">if he had never been born.</p>
	<p class="poem">Never having been born</p>
	<p class="poem">would be like annihilation in hell;</p>
	<p class="poem">but there is no annihilation in hell,</p>

	<p class="poem">into everlasting punishment..&quot; <a  id = "R65" class = "note" href = "#N56">56</a></p>
	<p class="poem">Isa himself warned about the eternal reality of hell</p>
	<p class="poem">more solemnly and emphatically than anyone.</p>
	<p class="poem">Therefore, if you want to think like Judas</p>
	<p class="poem">and harbor treacherous thoughts that the Word of God is error</p>
	<p class="poem">and harden your heart's gratitude</p>
	<p class="poem">against Isa's sacrifice for you to save you from hell,</p>
	<p class="poem">then there definitely will be room in hell for you with Judas.</p>
	<p class="poem">But it would be better for you if you had never been born.</p>
	<p class="poem">The moral judgment of God will require</p>
	<p class="poem">that every living rebel</p>
	<p class="poem">will be abandoned forever in the conscious state of his rebellion</p>
	<p class="poem">as eternal just retribution.</p>
	<p class="poem">Who could be a bigger fool</p>
	<p class="poem">than the one who scoffs</p>
	<p class="poem">at the sacrificial love of the Word of God</p>
	<p class="poem">who died and rose</p>
	<p class="poem">to speak eternal life into our hearts</p>
	<p class="poem">and to breathe on us the Eternal Spirit?</p>
	<p class="poem">This state could have been avoided</p>

	<p class="poem">The person he saw with her was in the act</p>
	<p class="poem">of committing adultery.</p>
	<p class="poem">The man of God stood before the congregation</p>
	<p class="poem">and he could not begin the khutba (sermon),</p>

	<p class="poem">&quot;Why should she?&quot; she thought.</p>
	<p class="poem">No one had caught her in the act,</p>
	<p class="poem">and as far as the man of God was concerned,</p>

	<p class="poem">Had he not used a gift of His Eternal Spirit,</p>

	<p class="poem">Did you not know that al-Haqq (the Truth)</p>
	<p class="poem">came as Truth to bear witness to the Truth?</p>

	<p class="poem">God thus summarily put to death</p>

	<p class="poem">in the race of the Word of <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> .</p>
	<p class="poem">Why is the death and rebirth of the whole race of Man</p>
	<p class="poem">necessary?</p>
	<p class="poem">God could not let our sinful will go unpunished.</p>
	<p class="poem">His honor could not allow it.</p>
	<p class="poem">His justice demanded punishment</p>

	<p class="poem">However, God loves the world</p>

	<p class="poem">to get her decision:</p>
	<p class="poem">will she or will she not</p>
	<p class="poem">let Him make her into a new creation</p>

	<p class="poem">in covenant faithfulness and loyalty to Him,</p>
	<p class="poem">her death-deserving sin and its blood debt paid.</p>
	<p class="poem">He sent the Bridegroom of His Honor, His Word,</p>

	<p class="poem">and to serve the death warrant of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">on our sinful race.</p>
	<p class="poem">This was to save the honor of <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> .</p>
	<p class="poem">Then His Word came to life again</p>
	<p class="poem">to vouchsafe the promise of <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> to a new forgiven humanity</p>
	<p class="poem">who would leave their old corrupt minds</p>

	<p class="poem">Praise be unto <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  for His Eternal Word Isa!</p>
	<p class="poem">Then, honorably unburdened of their wicked past,</p>
	<p class="poem">all those who had longed to obey the Word of God</p>

	<p class="poem">You can receive the living Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  through faith</p>

	<p class="poem">But you say,</p>

	<p class="poem">Since the present is but a brief preparation</p>
	<p class="poem">for a more demanding future,</p>
	<p class="poem">the seeming prosperity of the wicked</p>
	<p class="poem">is really their curse,</p>
	<p class="poem">in that he who is muddled by money</p>
	<p class="poem">is ill-prepared for imminent coming judgment,</p>
	<p class="poem">and so his &quot;prosperity&quot; seals his doom.</p>
	<p class="poem">We are just one heart-beat away</p>

	<h2 class="subtitle">THE MERCY OF THE MESSIAH TOWARD THE UNFAITHFUL</h2>
	<p class="poem">The following true story</p>
	<p class="poem">illustrates both the justice and the merciful love</p>
	<p class="poem">of the eternal Word of <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>, Isa al-Masih:</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;At daybreak Isa appeared in the Temple again;</p>
	<p class="poem">and all the people came to him,</p>
	<p class="poem">and he sat down and taught them.</p>
	<p class="poem">The legalistic teachers and some members of the legalistic sect</p>
	<p class="poem">brought a woman along who had been caught</p>
	<p class="poem">committing adultery</p>
	<p class="poem">and, making her stand there in the middle, they said to Isa,</p>
	<p class="poem">'Teacher, this woman was caught</p>
	<p class="poem">in the very act of committing adultery.</p>
	<p class="poem">Now in the Taurat (Torah) Musa (Moses) has ordered us</p>
	<p class="poem">to stone women of this kind.</p>
	<p class="poem">What do you say about her?'</p>
	<p class="poem">They asked him this as a test,</p>
	<p class="poem">in order that they might have some charge</p>
	<p class="poem">to bring against him.</p>
	<p class="poem">But Isa bent down</p>
	<p class="poem">and started writing on the ground with his finger.</p>
	<p class="poem">And as they persisted with their question,</p>
	<p class="poem">he straightened up and said,</p>
	<p class="poem">'Let him who is without sin among you</p>
	<p class="poem">be the first to throw a stone at her.'</p>
	<p class="poem">Then he bent down and continued writing on the ground.</p>
	<p class="poem">When they heard this they went away one by one,</p>
	<p class="poem">beginning with the eldest,</p>
	<p class="poem">until the last one had gone and Isa was left alone</p>
	<p class="poem">with the woman standing before him.</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa again straightened up and said,</p>
	<p class="poem">'Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?'</p>
	<p class="poem">'No one, sir,' she replied.</p>
	<p class="poem">'Neither do I condemn you' said Isa.</p>
	<p class="poem">'Go and sin no more.' &quot; <a  id = "R63" class = "note" href = "#N63">63</a></p>
	<p class="poem">The woman in the story knew that she was as good as dead</p>
	<p class="poem">because two witnesses (the prescribed number)</p>
	<p class="poem">had caught her in the very act of committing adultery,</p>
	<p class="poem">of which the Torah's penalty was death.</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa could have treated her with loathing,</p>
	<p class="poem">as men all too often act toward women.</p>
	<p class="poem">Instead, he gave her new life and enabled her not to sin anymore</p>
	<p class="poem">but to surrender to <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  as a New Creation Muslim.</p>
	<p class="poem">This is God's will for all people, male and female,</p>
	<p class="poem">for <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  is the merciful giver of new life.</p>
	<p class="poem">THIS IS THE CONCLUSION OF THE MATTER</p>
	<p class="poem">In the beginning God</p>
	<p class="poem">thought</p>
	<p class="poem">and by His creative Word spoke.</p>
	<p class="poem">The divine Word called forth a universe out of nothing.</p>
	<p class="poem">And by nothing but His Word</p>
	<p class="poem">are the revolving stars held together.</p>
	<p class="poem">Of all the created beings,</p>
	<p class="poem">man alone has a reasonable word,</p>
	<p class="poem">an utterable word,</p>
	<p class="poem">a human word</p>
	<p class="poem">--and a self-seeing spirit.</p>
	<p class="poem">For humanity is not made in the likeness of an animal,</p>
	<p class="poem">but in the likeness of <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>

	<p class="poem">Eternal-God-with-His-Eternal-Word-and-His-Eternal-Spirit.</p>
	<p class="poem">He it is who is the true God.</p>
	<p class="poem">And this one God alone</p>
	<p class="poem">makes mankind into a new creation</p>
	<p class="poem">that reflects His glory</p>
	<p class="poem">because the mankind He makes new</p>
	<p class="poem">is Man-with-renewed-mind-and-regenerated-spirit.</p>
	<p class="poem">We lose the old rebellious selfhood but not the self.</p>
	<p class="poem">We lose our old independent identity but not our identity.</p>
	<p class="poem">We are not swallowed up into religious mysticism.</p>
	<p class="poem">We need no occultist techniques or exercises to approach <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> .</p>
	<p class="poem">All we need to do is to repent</p>
	<p class="poem">and bring every thought captive to obey the Word</p>
	<p class="poem">by yielding to the power of the Eternal Spirit,</p>
	<p class="poem">so that the mind that was in Isa al-Masih is in us</p>

Epiphanius tells us the Collyridians practiced in  Arabia.&nbsp; Sura 
5:77/73 and similar references are against tritheism  --belief in 
three gods--a doctrine true believers have always  rejected. God 
is one, but He has always had personal distinctions  within 
Himself that included His Word and His Eternal Holy  Spirit.&nbsp; See 
Sura 4:171 for a reference to &quot;His Word&quot; Isa or  Jesus and see

</p><p id = "N21" class = "note"><span class="note_number">21</span> This teaching cannot be overemphasized.&nbsp; The  terms &quot;Father&quot; 
and &quot;Son&quot; are human analogies or metaphors to  give some 
understanding of God as He relates personally to His Word  and as 
His Word relates personally to Him. These terms do not  indicate 
polytheism as the daughters of God did in Sura  53:19-21.&nbsp; In Sura 
9:30, the title &quot;Son of God&quot; is objected to  because it is seen as 
reflecting the earlier polytheism too.&nbsp; Nor should  the title 
imply physical paternity, a concept opposed by Sura  6:101.&nbsp; The 
word &quot;Father&quot; is metaphorical as in the Arabic  name Abu' 
l-Barakat, the Father of Blessings.&nbsp; Likewise the  word &quot;Son&quot; is 
metaphorical in the Quranic designation Ibn al-Sabil,  &quot;son of the 
road,&quot; hence traveler.&nbsp; Sura 2:215  <a class = "return" href = "#R21"> (&nbsp;Return&nbsp) </a>

Isa claims what only the personal Word of God can claim:  fullness 
of knowledge of God.&nbsp; This is significant to readers  of the 
Qur'an, since nowhere in the Qur'an does it say that the  Injil

was given the divine authority to judge the whole world  and 
yet the figure in the vision looked like a human  being.&nbsp; Isa used 
the term &quot;Son of Man&quot; as a description of  himself. It&nbsp; was his 
favorite messianic title. The 1947 discovery of the two  thousand 
year old Dead Sea Scrolls contains several passages from 
Daniel. These passages are scientific proof that Daniel's  prophecy

</p><p id = "N34" class = "note"><span class="note_number">34</span> Ranks 37:107. Some may say that this verse is being  quoted 
out of context, since it originally referred to Ibrahim,  his son, 
and the ram.&nbsp; However, Isa himself said that  &quot;these same 
Scriptures--meaning the Torah accounts including this  story about 
Abraham--refer to me.&quot;(John 5:39) Everything written  about him 
(Isa) in the Law of Moses had to be fulfilled, according  to Isa's 
own words in Luke 24:44. The interpretation of the  Messiah 
himself was that Noah, Joseph, and Ibrahim's son, etc.  are all 
properly interpreted to be prophetic foreshadowings of Isa. 
Therefore, if the Qur'an refers to stories or characters 
in the Law of Moses, then since the original context in  the 
Taurat refers prophetically to Isa, it is arbitrary and  wrong to 
exclude this meaning from the Qur'an.&nbsp; A true  prophet does not go 
beyond what is written (I Corinthians 4:6). If Isa is  present in 
the original Biblical context, Isa cannot be erased in  any 
subsequent reference to that context, whether in the  Qur'an or 
elsewhere.&nbsp; Notice that in this Qur'anic reference  we are talking 
about a substitutionary sacrifice.&nbsp; Qur'anic  commentators who 
disagree can be dismissed because they are not prophets  and their 
comments do not carry prophetic authority. This is true  also of 
their Qur'anic interpretation that says Isa did not die.  <a class = "return" href = "#R34"> (&nbsp;Return&nbsp) </a>

over the demonic principalities and powers because of the 
victory He won on the cross as the Word of God. For he  provided a 
death for us that takes away Satan's power over us, the  fear of 
death resulting from sin.&nbsp; But though sin and death  caught us in 
a Devilish cycle, righteousness and life come to us  through faith 
in the Word of God and His death and resurrection for our
