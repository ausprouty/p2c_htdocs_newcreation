<h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0">THE NEW CREATION CONFESSION (KALIMAH)</h1>
	<p class="poem">Did you know</p>
	<p class="poem">that you must be made a new creation</p>
	<p class="poem">by the personal Spirit of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>?</p>
	<p class="poem">Many people do not know this is true but it is.</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa who is the Truth says so <a id="R154" class="note" href="confession_split_002.html#N154">154</a></p>
	<p class="poem">You must be spiritually formed and recreated</p>
	<p class="poem">in the resurrection life he manifested</p>
	<p class="poem">when Isa the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">defeated death and rose from the grave.</p>
	<p class="poem">This new creation that Isa insists on</p>
	<p class="poem">is not something you can live without.</p>
	<p class="poem">Nor can you avoid making a choice.</p>
	<p class="poem">You yourself will choose</p>
	<p class="poem">either by accepting, rejecting, or neglecting</p>
	<p class="poem">the Spiritual new birth</p>
	<p class="poem">and thereby you will choose your eternal destiny.</p>
	<p class="poem">There are two human races in the world:</p>
	<p class="poem">one that has been born only once</p>
	<p class="poem">and is moving toward</p>
	<p class="poem">eternal divine separation and death;</p>
	<p class="poem">and the other that has been born twice</p>
	<p class="poem">and is moving toward eternal communion <a id="R155" class="note" href="confession_split_002.html#N155">155</a> and peace</p>
	<p class="poem">and joy in the Eternal Spirit.</p>
	<p class="poem">You must be born from the one race into the other.</p>
	<p class="poem">You must be born again.</p>
	<p class="poem">The human race was created to be perfect</p>
	<p class="poem">and to reflect a perfect God.</p>
	<p class="poem">But the whole family of man has broken God's laws</p>
	<p class="poem">and has warped itself into a sinful disposition.<a id="R156" class="note" href="confession_split_002.html#N156">156</a></p>
	<p class="poem">Fulfilling the desires</p>
	<p class="poem">of the old nature and of the old mind,</p>
	<p class="poem">we are naturally culpable,</p>
	<p class="poem">alienated and headed for judgment.</p>
	<p class="poem">We need the new birth and the new life</p>
	<p class="poem">of holy fellowship (zamala) in God's Risen Word Jesus (Isa) in</p>
	<p class="poem">order than we may become spiritually alive.</p>
	<p class="poem">The true path of life</p>
	<p class="poem">is the path God has given us.</p>
	<p class="poem">The Word of God (Isa)</p>
	<p class="poem">did something in love on our behalf:</p>
	<p class="poem">he mercifully took his own Death Judgment against us</p>
	<p class="poem">upon himself.</p>
	<p class="poem">Then he destroyed the power of death</p>
	<p class="poem">by conquering the grave even as he died in our place.</p>
	<p class="poem">Whoever says this is not true is lying</p>
	<p class="poem">and is being seduced by a powerful delusion.</p>
	<p class="poem">The wisdom of such a one</p>
	<p class="poem">is not from above</p>
	<p class="poem">but is earthly, sensual, devilish. <a id="R157" class="note" href="confession_split_002.html#N157">157</a></p>
	<p class="poem">But if you allow the truth</p>
	<p class="poem">to touch your heart deeply,</p>
	<p class="poem">and if you believe this truth in your heart</p>
	<p class="poem">and confess this truth with your lips,</p>
	<p class="poem">you will begin the pilgrimage of true life.</p>
	<p class="poem">What is next is thrilling and wonderful:</p>
	<p class="poem">we confess this truth before the true believers</p>
	<p class="poem">and we begin to digest and to enact this truth</p>
	<p class="poem">with our body and our whole being,</p>
	<p class="poem">and we follow this truth</p>
	<p class="poem">and study this truth</p>
	<p class="poem">with God's people forever.</p>
	<p class="poem">Then what finally happens?</p>
	<p class="poem">The Truth himself (Isa) takes us</p>
	<p class="poem">from glory to glory.</p>
	<p class="poem">Praise God! Subhan <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>!</p>
	<p class="poem">HOW DOES ONE MAKE OUR KALIMAH OR CONFESSION?</p>
	<p class="poem">But how does one become</p>
	<p class="poem">a new creation Muslim</p>
	<p class="poem">with Isa alive in one's life?</p>
	<p class="poem">Only by faith in the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>.</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa declared that the whole Book</p>
	<p class="poem">spoke of nothing but his coming.<a id="R158" class="note" href="confession_split_002.html#N158">158</a></p>
	<p class="poem">And, true it is,</p>
	<p class="poem">that Isa is the central theme of the true Kitab</p>
	<p class="poem">and the focus of all our revelation of eternal life.</p>
	<p class="poem">What other man is the Word of eternal life of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>?</p>
	<p class="poem">Who but the death-conquering eternal Word in person</p>
	<p class="poem">could say convincingly:</p>
	<p class="poem">"I am the way, the truth, and the (eternal) life;</p>
	<p class="poem">no man comes to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>but through me"? <a id="R159" class="note" href="confession_split_002.html#N159">159</a></p>
	<p class="poem">Isa declared emphatically</p>
	<p class="poem">that just as <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  has eternal life in himself</p>
	<p class="poem">so he has granted his Word to have eternal life in himself;<a id="R160" class="note" href="confession_split_002.html#N160">160</a></p>
	<p class="poem">for his Word is his heir</p>
	<p class="poem">to whom <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  has given all authority</p>
	<p class="poem">and power and dominion to judge and to rule</p>
	<p class="poem">the new holy age dawning in his light.</p>
	<p class="poem">But only those in whom Isa is living</p>
	<p class="poem">have new creation eyes and heart</p>
	<p class="poem">with which to see and receive the truth of Isa,</p>
	<p class="poem">truth inscribed in the written Word of God.</p>
	<p class="poem">Either literally</p>
	<p class="poem">or in prophetic foreshadowings</p>
	<p class="poem">or symbols,</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa and his truth are on every page</p>
	<p class="poem">of the infallibly accurate Kitab (Book).</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa is the Word of God</p>
	<p class="poem">and only his Words inspired by the Eternal Spirit</p>
	<p class="poem">are the true words of Scripture.</p>
	<p class="poem">If this is the truth,</p>
	<p class="poem">why then does not everyone believe it?</p>
	<p class="poem">Because the man without the Eternal Spirit of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">does not accept the words</p>
	<p class="poem">that come from the Eternal Spirit of God, <a id="R161" class="note" href="confession_split_002.html#N161">161</a></p>
	<p class="poem">and no one can say that Isa</p>
	<p class="poem">is the personal, eternal, divine Word</p>
	<p class="poem">of God's Judgment</p>
	<p class="poem">without the aid of the Eternal Spirit.<a id="R162" class="note" href="confession_split_002.html#N162">162</a></p>
	<p class="poem">No one can say that "there is no deity but God</p>
	<p class="poem">and that Isa is the Word of God"</p>
	<p class="poem">without the aid of the Eternal Spirit.</p>
	<p class="poem">The natural man,</p>
	<p class="poem">even if he is religious</p>
	<p class="poem">or great by the measure of natural men,</p>
	<p class="poem">has no taste for the saving Word Isa</p>
	<p class="poem">spiritually discerned in the written Word of God.</p>
	<p class="poem">This natural and unregenerated man</p>
	<p class="poem">has received a different kitab (book)</p>
	<p class="poem">and a different salvation message</p>
	<p class="poem">and a different Jesus (Isa) <a id="R163" class="note" href="confession_split_002.html#N163">163</a>.</p>
	<p class="poem">But the true Kitab plainly says</p>
	<p class="poem">that if any man comes</p>
	<p class="poem">bringing a different salvation message</p>
	<p class="poem">let him be eternally condemned to hell <a id="R164" class="note" href="confession_split_002.html#N164">164</a></p>
	<p class="poem">There are many imitations of Isa</p>
	<p class="poem">that men in their cunning have preached.</p>
	<p class="poem">But the only true Isa</p>
	<p class="poem">is the one revealed in the infallible Word</p>
	<p class="poem">once for all delivered to the people who belong to God.</p>
	<p class="poem">No man can add to this revelation</p>
	<p class="poem">and no man can take away from it.</p>
	<p class="poem">It is imperishable and unchangeable.</p>
	<p class="poem">Therefore, you must discern the true words of Isa.</p>
	<p class="poem">And you must see Isa truly</p>
	<p class="poem">in the true words of prophecy.</p>
	<p class="poem">These immortal words</p>
	<p class="poem">were given by revelation</p>
	<p class="poem">through the personal Spirit of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">to those men of old who knew</p>
	<p class="poem">personally the ever-living Word of God</p>
	<p class="poem">even before the divine Word put on human form</p>
	<p class="poem">as Isa al-Masih.<a id="R165" class="note" href="confession_split_002.html#N165">165</a></p>
	<p class="poem">In the prophets <a id="R166" class="note" href="confession_split_002.html#N166">166</a></p>
	<p class="poem">God had promised salvation</p>
	<p class="poem">to all those who looked when they prayed</p>
	<p class="poem">toward the direction <a id="R167" class="note" href="confession_split_002.html#N167">167</a> .</p>
	<p class="poem">where His Name would dwell.</p>
	<p class="poem">The Name of God in Scripture</p>
	<p class="poem">is his personal self-disclosure,</p>
	<p class="poem">and God discloses himself by His Word.</p>
	<p class="poem">God had promised that His Word</p>
	<p class="poem">would meet with the people</p>
	<p class="poem">and tabernacle among them</p>
	<p class="poem">in the power of the Eternal Spirit.</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa is that Word.</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa is that Name.</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa is that tent of meeting with God in the desert ofthis world,</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa is that moveable pilgrim's feast,</p>
	<p class="poem">that spiritual bread of display,</p>
	<p class="poem">the one who came down from heaven</p>
	<p class="poem">that all men might digest who he is</p>
	<p class="poem">and live forever.</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa is that mysterious lampstand</p>
	<p class="poem">and that light of the niche (mishkat-ul-anwar)</p>
	<p class="poem">that lights up the dead, dark hearts of men.</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa is the Covenant Word of Eternal Life.</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa is the pilgrim's acceptable sacrifice.</p>
	<p class="poem">Sin led to the destruction</p>
	<p class="poem">of the house of God in al-Quds (Jerusalem),</p>
	<p class="poem">and to the continuing holocaust of our Exile.<a id="R168" class="note" href="confession_split_002.html#N168">168</a></p>
	<p class="poem">But if God did not spare the ancient children of Ibrahim,</p>
	<p class="poem">he will not spare us either,</p>
	<p class="poem">if we join them in their unbelief <a id="R169" class="note" href="confession_split_002.html#N169">169</a></p>
	<p class="poem">And if judgment begins with the household of God</p>
	<p class="poem">what shall be the fate of those</p>
	<p class="poem">who disbelieve Isa's message?<a id="R170" class="note" href="confession_split_002.html#N170">170</a></p>
	<p class="poem">They too shall be judged</p>
	<p class="poem">by the divine Word of Judgment</p>
	<p class="poem">who is himself the indestructible House of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">willingly torn down by men, yes,</p>
	<p class="poem">but only to mercifully make atonement (takfeer)</p>
	<p class="poem">in order to be resurrected from the dead forever</p>
	<p class="poem">by the Holy God of Ibrahim</p>
	<p class="poem">as the true direction of our prayers.</p>

	<p class="poem">OUR CONFESSION IN OUR ID UL-ADHA REMEMBRANCE</p>
	<p class="poem">When we New Creation Muslims confess the saving truth</p>
	<p class="poem">in our New Creation Id ul-Adha service,</p>
	<p class="poem">our worship is more than mere lip service</p>
	<p class="poem">or an empty religious ritual.</p>
	<p class="poem">When we eat and drink in the Id ul-Adha of Isa,</p>
	<p class="poem">we are renewing</p>
	<p class="poem">God's solemn covenant promise to Ibrahim <a id="R171" class="note" href="confession_split_002.html#N171">171</a></p>
	<p class="poem">his unchangeable contractual pledge</p>
	<p class="poem">that constitutes the basis of our salvation.</p>
	<p class="poem">THE ID UL-ADHA EXPLAINED</p>
	<p class="poem">It says in the Qur'an</p>
	<p class="poem">that if a pilgrim is prevented</p>
	<p class="poem">from completing the Hajj (Pilgrimage),</p>
	<p class="poem">"send an offering</p>
	<p class="poem">for sacrifice."<a id="R172" class="note" href="confession_split_002.html#N172">172</a></p>
	<p class="poem">At the climax of the Hajj,</p>
	<p class="poem">a sacrificial meal is eaten</p>
	<p class="poem">that remembers the God</p>
	<p class="poem">who has been faithful to us since</p>
	<p class="poem">the days of Ibrahim,</p>
	<p class="poem">when God ransomed Ibrahim's heir</p>
	<p class="poem">with a "momentous sacrifice."</p>
	<p class="poem">Id ul-Adha is the "Feast of Sacrifice"</p>
	<p class="poem">when pilgrims remember</p>
	<p class="poem">the act of divine mercy of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> to Ibrahim.</p>
	<p class="poem">All over the world,</p>
	<p class="poem">a joyful feast of recollection is held</p>
	<p class="poem">simultaneously at the time of the hajj (pilgrimage).</p>
	<p class="poem">To remember God's mercy to Ibrahim</p>
	<p class="poem">with a "more lively remembrance"</p>
	<p class="poem">is the intention of the feast.</p>
	<p class="poem">Not only in Mina (near Mecca),</p>
	<p class="poem">but universally and corporately,</p>
	<p class="poem">all the believers are to become pilgrims in spirit</p>
	<p class="poem">by joining in the meal wherever they are.</p>
	<p class="poem">Their purpose is to achieve not merely a remembrance</p>
	<p class="poem">but a corporate identity</p>
	<p class="poem">as a worshiping community (ummah).</p>
	<p class="poem">The pilgrims who offer the sacrificial sheep</p>
	<p class="poem">or other animal have read this saying:</p>
	<p class="poem">"It is not their meat</p>
	<p class="poem">nor their blood that reaches <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> ."<a id="R173" class="note" href="confession_split_002.html#N173">173</a></p>
	<p class="poem">We read in the Kitab of the Injil (the New Testament)</p>

	<p class="poem">His name was Talut or Saul</p>
	<p class="poem">because he had been named after King Saul</p>
	<p class="poem">and was from the same tribe.</p>
	<p class="poem">Saul was a great Jewish mullah,</p>
	<p class="poem">a great learned man so zealous in his religious knowledge</p>
	<p class="poem">that he persecuted all those who said that they</p>

	<p class="poem">by the risen Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  Himself, Isa the Messiah.</p>
	<p class="poem">It was then that Saul began a series of religious pilgrimages</p>
	<p class="poem">that each led him inevitably back to al-Quds</p>
	<p class="poem">as he travelled the world as the Apostle Paul.</p>
	<p class="poem">To show that the Good News is not based on</p>

	<p class="poem">He did not deserve a mullah's honorific position.</p>
	<p class="poem">He deserved no place of honor in the Lord's house.</p>

	<p class="poem">that he was a true-to-his-traditions submitter to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> .</p>
	<p class="poem">Why was this proof so important to Paul?</p>
	<p class="poem">Because he knew that traditions were not the issue</p>
	<p class="poem">--what mattered was becoming a new creation.</p>
	<p class="poem">Paul was willing to become like the sons of Ishmael</p>
	<p class="poem">to win the sons of Ishmael</p>
	<p class="poem">and he was willing to become like the sons of Israel</p>

	<p class="poem">if it would bring the Word of Salvation Jesus</p>
