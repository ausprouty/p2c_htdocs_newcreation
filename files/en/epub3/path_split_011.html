<h2 class="subtitle" id="calibre_pb_10">HOW TO ADMIT THE INFALLIBLE RELIABILITY OF THE WORD</h2>
	<p class="poem">We must receive a new spirit,</p>
	<p class="poem">a spirit like the Eternal Spirit.</p>
	<p class="poem">For God will be faithful</p>
	<p class="poem">only with the faithful <a id="R44" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N44">44</a> and His pure light</p>
	<p class="poem">will shine forth from the Word only for the pure.</p>
	<p class="poem">With the wicked who fail to tremble at His Word,</p>
	<p class="poem">God is angry every day. <a id="R45" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N45">45</a></p>
	<p class="poem">Like many long ago who were quick</p>
	<p class="poem">to accuse Isa al-Masih of error</p>
	<p class="poem">but were slow to see error in themselves,</p>
	<p class="poem">so today these vile unbelievers are quick</p>
	<p class="poem">to do the same with His written Word.</p>
	<p class="poem">The natural man cannot understand the words of the Spirit;</p>
	<p class="poem">they are beyond him,</p>
	<p class="poem">they are foolishness to him.</p>
	<p class="poem">How can anyone understand</p>
	<p class="poem">what is eternal and spiritually discerned</p>
	<p class="poem">if he lacks the Eternal Spirit?</p>
	<p class="poem">Reading is not enough;</p>
	<p class="poem">the words are straight but the reader is crooked.</p>
	<p class="poem">The reader must be reborn</p>
	<p class="poem">and be set on the straight path</p>
	<p class="poem">not by mere human resolve</p>
	<p class="poem">but by the will of God. <a id="R46" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N46">46</a></p>
