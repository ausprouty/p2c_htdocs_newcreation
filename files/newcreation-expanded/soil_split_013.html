	<p class="poem">Now the story goes that Isa who is <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  's Word</p>
	<p class="poem">had been healing many people in Muqaddasa (the Holy Land). And</p>
	<p class="poem">when he sat down,</p>
	<p class="poem">each talib (seeker) also brought unto Isa</p>
	<p class="poem">his walad (little child)</p>
	<p class="poem">in order for him to pronounce the baraka (blessing).</p>
	<p class="poem">And so, with tender love, Isa,</p>
	<p class="poem">who reverberates the love of the heart of God,</p>
	<p class="poem">picked each one up</p>
	<p class="poem">and placed the walad (little child)</p>
	<p class="poem">one at a time on his lap.</p>
	<p class="poem">Just then his hawari (disciples)</p>
	<p class="poem">impatiently interrupted him and told the parents</p>
	<p class="poem">that they would have to leave.</p>
	<p class="poem">But Isa loved little children who, as everyone knows,</p>
	<p class="poem">humbly and whole-heartedly receive what is given to them.</p>
	<p class="poem">Little children accept everything as a gift</p>
	<p class="poem">with awestruck gratitude as if from the hand of God,</p>
	<p class="poem">and not with any tendency</p>
	<p class="poem">to think they deserve God's favor on the basis of merit,</p>
	<p class="poem">since in their own small eyes</p>
	<p class="poem">they wisely know themselves too little</p>
	<p class="poem">to have done any good deeds.</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa said,</p>
	<p class="poem">"Allow the little children to come unto me</p>
	<p class="poem">and forbid them not.</p>
	<p class="poem">For it is to people with hearts like these</p>
	<p class="poem">that the Malakut (Kingdom) of God belongs.</p>
	<p class="poem">In very truth I say to you,</p>
	<p class="poem">whosoever shall not welcome</p>
	<p class="poem">the Malakut (Kingdom) of God</p>
	<p class="poem">like a walad (little child)</p>
	<p class="poem">will never enter it." <a class="note" id="R11" href="soil_split_015.html#N11">11</a></p>
