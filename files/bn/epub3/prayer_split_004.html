<h2 class="subtitle" id="calibre_pb_3">IN THE NEW CREATION, WE LIVE TOGETHER IN PEACE</h2>
	<p class="poem">That hostility has been put to death (Ephesians 2:16)</p>
	<p class="poem">by the Word who broke down all hostility</p>
	<p class="poem">in his body on the tree of hostility</p>
	<p class="poem">when he rose from the dead</p>
	<p class="poem">to assure us of our triumph with him over all hostility</p>
	<p class="poem">and our deliverance from the holy hostility of God.</p>
	<p class="poem">The hostility between Jews and Muslims</p>
	<p class="poem">over the land of Israel is displeasing to God.</p>
	<p class="poem">In his Word, God rebukes those who fight</p>
	<p class="poem">and kill each other over the land.</p>
	<p class="poem">God says, "The land shall not be sold forever:</p>
	<p class="poem">for the land is mine;</p>
	<p class="poem">for you are strangers and aliens with me."(Lev.25:23)</p>
	<p class="poem">The main point is that any land belongs to</p>
	<p class="poem">the God of creation</p>
	<p class="poem">We are all ephemeral dying aliens here,</p>
	<p class="poem">on a pilgrimage and under probation and testing</p>
	<p class="poem">to see if we will submit to the love of God</p>
	<p class="poem">as revealed by His Word Isa</p>
	<p class="poem">in the book Isa inspired.</p>
	<p class="poem">Those Jews who hate Muslims also hate the Holy God</p>
	<p class="poem">whose word promises He will save Muslims in the last days.</p>
	<p class="poem">Those Muslims who hate Jews also hate the Holy God</p>
	<p class="poem">whose Word promises He will breathe spiritual life</p>
	<p class="poem">into these dead bones in the last days.</p>
	<p class="poem">And, more thanÂ  that, they hate the God</p>
	<p class="poem">who promises these bones will be resurrected physically</p>
	<p class="poem">on the land of Ibrahim</p>
	<p class="poem">just as they will one day be resurrected spiritually</p>
	<p class="poem">in the true faith of Ibrahim.</p>
	<p class="poem">The Jew who hates the Muslim</p>
	<p class="poem">and the Muslim who hates the Jew</p>
	<p class="poem">hate the God of their common father Ibrahim</p>
	<p class="poem">for the Muslim and the Jew are brothers.</p>
	<p class="poem">If one kills the other over the land of Ibrahim,</p>
	<p class="poem">they are not gaining any ground with God.</p>
	<p class="poem">Both push each other into hell,</p>
	<p class="poem">and who is the better for all their wars?</p>
	<p class="poem">But what does the Scripture say?</p>
	<p class="poem">"Whoever hateth his brother is a murderer:</p>
	<p class="poem">and you know that no murderer</p>
	<p class="poem">has eternal life abiding in him!" (I John 3:15)</p>
	<p class="poem">You who say that you are a Jew</p>
	<p class="poem">(and are not because you hate your brother Muslim),</p>
	<p class="poem">repent or there is no eternal life abiding in you!</p>
	<p class="poem">You who say that you are a Muslim</p>
	<p class="poem">(and are not because you hate your brother Jew),</p>
	<p class="poem">repent or there is no eternal life abiding in you!</p>
	<p class="poem">If a Muslim or Jew says, 'I love God,'</p>
	<p class="poem">and hateth his brother,</p>
	<p class="poem">he is a liar:</p>
	<p class="poem">for he that loveth not his brother</p>
	<p class="poem">whom he hath seen,</p>
	<p class="poem">how can he love God</p>
	<p class="poem">whom he hath not seen?" (I John 4:20)</p>
