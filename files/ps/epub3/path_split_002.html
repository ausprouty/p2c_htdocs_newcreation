<h2 class="subtitle" id="calibre_pb_1">A PRAYER IS MIRACULOUSLY ANSWERED</h2>
	<p class="poem">The man of God was calling out to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> one morning</p>
	<p class="poem">to bring more people to the jami' (congregation).</p>
	<p class="poem">He was on his face before <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">and he was supplicating du'a (free-prayer) very loudly</p>
	<p class="poem">alone in a tiny apartment.</p>
	<p class="poem">This was the only masjid (place of prayer)</p>
	<p class="poem">the people had for their meetings</p>
	<p class="poem">because the godless leaders,</p>
	<p class="poem">more sensitive to politics than to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> ,</p>
	<p class="poem">had thrown the congregation</p>
	<p class="poem">out of a public meeting hall.</p>
	<p class="poem">But praise be to God who hears and answers</p>
	<p class="poem">when we call on Him!</p>
	<p class="poem">There is none like the Lord our God,</p>
	<p class="poem">praise be unto Him.</p>
	<p class="poem">He says somewhere,</p>
	<p class="poem">"Before they call I will answer,</p>
	<p class="poem">and while they are yet speaking I will hear."</p>
	<p class="poem">In fact, the request of the man of God</p>
	<p class="poem">had been answered weeks before he made his petition.</p>
