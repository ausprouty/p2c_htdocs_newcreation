	<h2 class="subtitle">HOW WELCOME IS THE TRUTH IN YOUR HOUSE?</h2>
	<p class="poem">Are you like our father Ibrahim (Abraham)?</p>
	<p class="poem">When three men came to his dwelling,</p>
	<p class="poem">Ibrahim could see who they really were</p>
	<p class="poem">--angels in disguise.</p>
	<p class="poem">So even though his wife laughed like a kafir (dis-believer),</p>
	<p class="poem"> our father Ibrahim</p>
	<p class="poem">opened his heart</p>
	<p class="poem">to their message. <a id = "R1" class = "note" href = "#N1">1</a></p>
	<p class="poem">Ibrahim not only recognized the truth</p>
	<p class="poem">but he also fearlessly welcomed it.</p>
	<h2 class="subtitle">THE FARMER AND THE FOUR KINDS OF SOIL</h2>
	<p class="poem">Different people react in different ways to the truth,</p>
	<p class="poem">just as, when a farmer plants his seed,</p>
	<p class="poem">various kinds of soil react variously.</p>
	<h2 class="subtitle">THE PARABLE (MATHAL) GIVEN</h2>
	<p class="poem">Imagine a farmer going out to plant seed.</p>
	<p class="poem">As the farmer planted the seed,</p>
	<p class="poem">some fell on the edge of the path,</p>
	<p class="poem">and the birds came and ate those seeds up.</p>
	<p class="poem">Others fell on rocky soil</p>
	<p class="poem">where they sprang up quickly;</p>
	<p class="poem">but as soon as the sun came up,</p>
	<p class="poem">those that were rootless and shallow plantings</p>
	<p class="poem">soon withered away.</p>
	<p class="poem">Other seeds fell among thorns</p>
	<p class="poem">which grew up and choked them.</p>
	<p class="poem">Finally, there were seeds that fell on rich soil</p>
	<p class="poem">and these seeds multiplied themselves</p>
	<p class="poem">in the fruit they produced--</p>
	<p class="poem">some a hundred times over,</p>
	<p class="poem">some sixty times over,</p>
	<p class="poem">some thirty.</p>
	<h2 class="subtitle">THE PARABLE (MATHAL) EXPLAINED</h2>
	<p class="poem">The truth comes like seed from a farmer's hand.</p>
	<p class="poem">The ears that hear the truth</p>
	<p class="poem">are like different kinds of soil</p>
	<p class="poem">receiving the farmer's seed.</p>
	<p class="poem">Ears without understanding hear the truth</p>
	<p class="poem">but Shaitan (Satan) comes</p>
	<p class="poem">like the birds along the path</p>
	<p class="poem">and carries the truth away</p>
	<p class="poem">as soon as it is planted in the hearer's heart.</p>
	<p class="poem">Ears with fickle attention hear the truth</p>
	<p class="poem">and welcome it at first with joy;</p>
	<p class="poem">but such a hearer has no unwavering root in himself</p>
	<p class="poem">and he does not last;</p>
	<p class="poem">when a crisis or a persecution comes</p>
	<p class="poem">on account of the truth,</p>
	<p class="poem">such a hearer falls away at once.</p>
	<p class="poem">Ears with divided desires hear the word,</p>
	<p class="poem">but the worries of this world,</p>
	<p class="poem">and the lure of riches,</p>
	<p class="poem">and the pleasures of life,</p>
	<p class="poem">are like thorns that choke the truth</p>
	<p class="poem">which produces in such a hearer absolutely nothing.</p>
	<p class="poem">However, ears with understanding hear the word</p>
	<p class="poem">like rich soil receiving seed.</p>
	<p class="poem">Such a hearer yields a great harvest,</p>
	<p class="poem">since a hundred or sixty or thirty times</p>
	<p class="poem">as many hearers may receive the truth through him.</p>
	<p class="poem">He who has ears to hear the truth</p>
	<p class="poem">of the following mathal (parable), let him hear!</p>
	<h2 class="subtitle">THE IBN DALL (SON OF ERROR)</h2>
	<p class="poem">There was once a hanif (one who desires true religion)</p>
	<p class="poem">who had two sons.</p>
	<p class="poem">The younger said to his father,</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;Father, according to the wasiya (will),</p>
	<p class="poem">let me have the fara'id (fixed share)</p>
	<p class="poem">of the mirath (inheritance)</p>
	<p class="poem">that is coming to me.&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">And the father divided his means and his property</p>
	<p class="poem">between the younger and the elder son.</p>
	<p class="poem">Now the elder son was a devout believer who prayed</p>
	<p class="poem">regularly five times a day</p>
	<p class="poem">and had made the Hajj (Pilgrimage) as many times.</p>
	<p class="poem">No one was respected more among the townspeople</p>
	<p class="poem">for his religious devotion than this elder son.</p>
	<p class="poem">He was a man who performed his prayers</p>
	<p class="poem">in the mosque with absolute perfection</p>
	<p class="poem">and could read the Qur'an so well</p>
	<p class="poem">that he would hold the audience spellbound.</p>
	<h2 class="subtitle">THE YOUNGER SON GOES ASTRAY</h2>
	<p class="poem">It wasn't long, however, until the younger son</p>
	<p class="poem">got everything he owned together,</p>
	<p class="poem">and left for a far country.</p>
	<p class="poem">There he squandered his money</p>
	<p class="poem">in a dissolute life of fisq (sinfulness)</p>
	<p class="poem">and moral depravity.</p>
	<p class="poem">And when he had spent his entire inheritance,</p>
	<p class="poem">and had not one thing left to remind him of his wonderful father,</p>
	<p class="poem">there arose a terrible famine in that land;</p>
	<p class="poem">and the younger son began to feel his loss.</p>
	<p class="poem">So he hired himself out to a harbi <a class = "note" id = "R2" href = "#N2">2</a></p>
	<p class="poem">who put him on his farm to feed the pigs.</p>
	<p class="poem">The younger son would willingly have filled his belly</p>
	<p class="poem">with the husks the pigs were eating</p>
	<p class="poem">but he was treated worse than the swine,</p>
	<p class="poem">for no one offered him even pigs' food to eat.</p>
	<h2 class="subtitle">THE YOUNGER SON FORSAKES ALL PRIDE AND SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2>

	<p class="poem">He finally came to himself</p>
	<p class="poem">and started thinking like an 'aqli (rational) being,</p>
	<p class="poem">like a true son having the disposition of his father.</p>
	<p class="poem">He said, &quot;How many hired servants of my father's household abound</p>
	<p class="poem">in food and I perish with hunger!</p>
	<p class="poem">I will arise and stop straying from fasaqa (the right course) and</p>
	<p class="poem">go to my father,</p>
	<p class="poem">and I will say to him,</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;Father, I have sinned against heaven</p>
	<p class="poem">and in the presence of you.</p>
	<p class="poem">And I no longer think I am worthy to be called your son:</p>
	<p class="poem">make me not like my elder brother who thinks himself worthy but</p>
	<p class="poem">make me like one of your hired servants.&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">Then he arose and came to his father.</p>
	<h2 class="subtitle">THE FATHER WHOSE LOVE MAKES THE UNRIGHTEOUS TO BE RIGHTEOUS</h2>
	<p class="poem">Now it was the tenth day</p>
	<p class="poem">of the month of Hajj (Pilgrimage),</p>
	<p class="poem">but the elder son, having a self-satisfied heart,</p>
	<p class="poem">had some time before decided to forego the trip.</p>
	<p class="poem">But when the younger son was yet a long way off,</p>
	<p class="poem">his father saw him.</p>
	<p class="poem">And greatly moved with love and compassion,</p>
	<p class="poem">his father ran to the younger son</p>
	<p class="poem">and clasped him in his arms</p>
	<p class="poem">and kissed him with tenderness.</p>
	<p class="poem">And the younger son said to him,</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;Father, I have sinned against heaven</p>
	<p class="poem">and in your sight,</p>
	<p class="poem">and I am no longer worthy to be called your son.&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">But the father said to his hired servants,</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;Bring forth the best robe</p>
	<p class="poem">and put it on him;</p>
	<p class="poem">and put a ring on his hand</p>
	<p class="poem">and shoes on his feet;</p>
	<p class="poem">and bring the calf we have been fattening and kill it;</p>
	<p class="poem">we are going to have</p>
	<p class="poem">a Qurban (Sacrifice) as on 'Id al-Adha <a class = "note" id = "R3" href = "#N3">3</a></p>
	<p class="poem">such as has not been since the time Ibrahim</p>
	<p class="poem">celebrated the redemption of his son.</p>
	<p class="poem">Because this son of mine was dead</p>
	<p class="poem">and has come back to life;</p>
	<p class="poem">he was lost</p>
	<p class="poem">and now he has been found.&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">And the great feast began.</p>
	<h2 class="subtitle">THE ELDER SON REFUSES TO FORSAKE A SELF-RIGHTEOUS AND PROUD RELIGIOUS SPIRIT</h2>
	<p class="poem">Now the elder brother</p>
	<p class="poem">had just returned from the mosque,</p>
	<p class="poem">and, on his way back, as he drew near the house,</p>
	<p class="poem">he could hear the sounds of the wisal (communion)</p>
	<p class="poem">of the father and his younger son.</p>
	<p class="poem">Calling one of the hired servants,</p>
	<p class="poem">the elder brother asked what all this was about.</p>
	<p class="poem">And the hired servant said to the elder son,</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;Your brother has returned safe and salim (sound)</p>
	<p class="poem">and your father has personally sent word</p>
	<p class="poem">for the Qurban (sacrifice) and the festivities to begin.&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">Now the elder brother was furious</p>
	<p class="poem">and refused to go in.</p>
	<p class="poem">He would have nothing</p>
	<p class="poem">to do with this sort of din (religious practice).</p>
	<p class="poem">Would God act like his father? <a class = "note" id = "R4" href = "#N4">4</a></p>
	<p class="poem">Would <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> bestow a matwaba (reward) on a son</p>
	<p class="poem">with an innate qariha (disposition)</p>
	<p class="poem">that was asin (rebellious)?</p>
	<p class="poem">And not only that, one who had no tawab (merit)</p>
	<p class="poem">because he had done absolutely no good deeds</p>
	<p class="poem">or ihsan (right conduct)</p>
	<p class="poem">--would <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> act like this sort of father?</p>
	<p class="poem">The elder brother resolved to never be like such a one</p>
	<p class="poem">and he sat down and brooded in the outer darkness.</p>
	<h2 class="subtitle">FAILING TO RECOGNIZE THE WORD OF THE FATHER</h2>
	<p class="poem">Presently the elder brother</p>
	<p class="poem">thought he saw another servant approaching.</p>
	<p class="poem">But it was really his father</p>
	<p class="poem">coming to give him a personal word <a class = "note" id = "R5" href = "#N5">5</a></p>
	<p class="poem">in order that the elder son could start thinking</p>
	<p class="poem">like an 'aqli (rational) being</p>
	<p class="poem">and enter into the spirit of the whole jam'a'a (house).</p>
	<p class="poem">So his father pleaded with him.</p>
	<p class="poem">Finally the elder son answered the man:</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;Look, all these years I have submitted (islam) <a class = "note" id = "R6" href = "#N6">6</a></p>
	<p class="poem">to you as an abd (slave)</p>
	<p class="poem">and I can boast without shame that</p>
	<p class="poem">I have religiously obeyed all of the shari'a (laws)</p>
	<p class="poem">of this whole jam'a'a (house).</p>
	<p class="poem">Yet I return from the mosque</p>
	<p class="poem">and I hear the sounds of the wisal (conununion)</p>
	<p class="poem">between you and this mufarrit (prodigal)!</p>
	<p class="poem">Am I now to humble myself</p>
	<p class="poem">and enter a house with this sort of zamala (fellowship)?&quot;</p>
	<h2 class="subtitle">A COSTLY DEATH AND THE INHERITANCE OF THE FATHER'S PERSONAL WORD TO HIS HEIRS</h2>

	<p class="poem">Then the father looked at him with anguished love</p>
	<p class="poem">and said,</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;You know the costly death a murith (testator)</p>
	<p class="poem">must somehow undergo in order that his heirs</p>
	<p class="poem">may receive all that he has.</p>
	<p class="poem">And yet you seem to love me</p>
	<p class="poem">more like a self-justifying slave</p>
	<p class="poem">than a trusting and humble son.&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">The father put his arm around the man and said,</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;Are you so far away from knowing me</p>
	<p class="poem">that you cannot rejoice that the one</p>
	<p class="poem">who strayed from the fasaqa (right course)</p>
