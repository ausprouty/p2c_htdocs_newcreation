<p id = "N207" class = "note"><span class="note_number">207</span> Some may object to the use of 'Id ul-Adha as a name  for a 
contextualized communion since 'Id ul-Adha refers to a  specific 
day of the year, whereas communion is celebrated more  frequently. 
However, the Lord's Seder is a once-a-year festival  (Passover) 
that Isa turned into a remembrance meal of more frequent 
celebration. Since both Passover and 'Id ul-Adha have  connections 
with Abraham's sacrifice and with the concept of mystical 
communion in a world-embracing ummah or community, the  choice of 
contextualized terminology seems apt.

their hearers considered attractive labels. Take for  instance the 
word &quot;circumcision,&quot; which certain legalists  dangled before 
Paul's disciples. Notice that in Philippians 3:3 Paul  does not 
allow this attractive word to be captured by them, but  snatches 
it back, disinfects it of any content from their false teaching, 
pours pure Biblical content into the word, and then  commandeers 
the word into the service of the Great Commission of  Matthew 
28:19-20.&nbsp; Those believers in Isa who needlessly  forfeit the use 
of the word &quot;<span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">

acceptable contextualized form.&nbsp; However, these are  not at all 
the issues this book intends to settle, and there is no  time or 
space to pause for comment.

ghusl of Isa is automatically going to hell. It does  mean, 
however, that anyone who says that he believes in Isa and  yet 
refuses to submit to his command--Matthew  28:19-20--regarding 
this ordinance is in danger of coming under the judgment  of the 
Word of God: &quot;The man who says, 'I know him' while  he disobeys 
his commands, is a liar and a stranger to the truth'--I  John 
2:4. &quot;Whoever runs ahead and does not continue in  the

ways.&nbsp; We should avoid faithless unbelief when we  need a healing, 
but we should also avoid creating simplistic formulas for  God, as 
Job and other sections of Scripture warn us.

is no difference between male and female.&nbsp; To preach  this, the 
men were apparently wearing their wives' veils and  scandalizing 
local custom.
