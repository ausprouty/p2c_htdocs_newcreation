<h2 class="subtitle" id="calibre_pb_15">THE MERCY OF THE MESSIAH TOWARD THE UNFAITHFUL</h2>
	<p class="poem">The following true story</p>
	<p class="poem">illustrates both the justice and the merciful love</p>
	<p class="poem">of the eternal Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>, Isa al-Masih:</p>
	<p class="poem">"At daybreak Isa appeared in the Temple again;</p>
	<p class="poem">and all the people came to him,</p>
	<p class="poem">and he sat down and taught them.</p>
	<p class="poem">The legalistic teachers and some members of the legalistic sect</p>
	<p class="poem">brought a woman along who had been caught</p>
	<p class="poem">committing adultery</p>
	<p class="poem">and, making her stand there in the middle, they said to Isa,</p>
	<p class="poem">'Teacher, this woman was caught</p>
	<p class="poem">in the very act of committing adultery.</p>
	<p class="poem">Now in the Taurat (Torah) Musa (Moses) has ordered us</p>
	<p class="poem">to stone women of this kind.</p>
	<p class="poem">What do you say about her?'</p>
	<p class="poem">They asked him this as a test,</p>
	<p class="poem">in order that they might have some charge</p>
	<p class="poem">to bring against him.</p>
	<p class="poem">But Isa bent down</p>
	<p class="poem">and started writing on the ground with his finger.</p>
	<p class="poem">And as they persisted with their question,</p>
	<p class="poem">he straightened up and said,</p>
	<p class="poem">'Let him who is without sin among you</p>
	<p class="poem">be the first to throw a stone at her.'</p>
	<p class="poem">Then he bent down and continued writing on the ground.</p>
	<p class="poem">When they heard this they went away one by one,</p>
	<p class="poem">beginning with the eldest,</p>
	<p class="poem">until the last one had gone and Isa was left alone</p>
	<p class="poem">with the woman standing before him.</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa again straightened up and said,</p>
	<p class="poem">'Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?'</p>
	<p class="poem">'No one, sir,' she replied.</p>
	<p class="poem">'Neither do I condemn you' said Isa.</p>
	<p class="poem">'Go and sin no more.' " <a id="R63" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N63">63</a></p>
	<p class="poem">The woman in the story knew that she was as good as dead</p>
	<p class="poem">because two witnesses (the prescribed number)</p>
	<p class="poem">had caught her in the very act of committing adultery,</p>
	<p class="poem">of which the Torah's penalty was death.</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa could have treated her with loathing,</p>
	<p class="poem">as men all too often act toward women.</p>
	<p class="poem">Instead, he gave her new life and enabled her not to sin anymore</p>
	<p class="poem">but to surrender to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  as a New Creation Muslim.</p>
	<p class="poem">This is God's will for all people, male and female,</p>
	<p class="poem">for <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  is the merciful giver of new life.</p>
	<p class="poem">THIS IS THE CONCLUSION OF THE MATTER</p>
	<p class="poem">In the beginning God</p>
	<p class="poem">thought</p>
	<p class="poem">and by His creative Word spoke.</p>
	<p class="poem">The divine Word called forth a universe out of nothing.</p>
	<p class="poem">And by nothing but His Word</p>
	<p class="poem">are the revolving stars held together.</p>
	<p class="poem">Of all the created beings,</p>
	<p class="poem">man alone has a reasonable word,</p>
	<p class="poem">an utterable word,</p>
	<p class="poem">a human word</p>
	<p class="poem">--and a self-seeing spirit.</p>
	<p class="poem">For humanity is not made in the likeness of an animal,</p>
	<p class="poem">but in the likeness of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">who is</p>
	<p class="poem">Eternal-God-with-His-Eternal-Word-and-His-Eternal-Spirit.</p>
	<p class="poem">He it is who is the true God.</p>
	<p class="poem">And this one God alone</p>
	<p class="poem">makes mankind into a new creation</p>
	<p class="poem">that reflects His glory</p>
	<p class="poem">because the mankind He makes new</p>
	<p class="poem">is Man-with-renewed-mind-and-regenerated-spirit.</p>
	<p class="poem">We lose the old rebellious selfhood but not the self.</p>
	<p class="poem">We lose our old independent identity but not our identity.</p>
	<p class="poem">We are not swallowed up into religious mysticism.</p>
	<p class="poem">We need no occultist techniques or exercises to approach <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> .</p>
	<p class="poem">All we need to do is to repent</p>
	<p class="poem">and bring every thought captive to obey the Word</p>
	<p class="poem">by yielding to the power of the Eternal Spirit,</p>
	<p class="poem">so that the mind that was in Isa al-Masih is in us</p>
	<p class="poem">as we live and speak and act in inner communion with Him.</p>
