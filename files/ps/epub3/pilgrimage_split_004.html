<h2 class="subtitle" id="calibre_pb_3">AHMAD TELLS HIS OWN STORY</h2>
	<p class="text">I had been raised as a Muslim in a very Muslim house for 
	 the first eighteen years that I was at home. Later, as an 
	 adult, I started hearing about Jesus. According to the Qur'an I 
	 had believed that Jesus was one of God's prophets.</p>
	<p class="text">As time went on, I started hearing more and more about him, how 
	 he died for the human race to set men free from sin, sickness and 
	 every bondage. Prior to hearing all this, I had always wondered 
	 about sickness and disease and why God would take so many people 
	 at a very young age or put sickness on them. If mankind is God's 
	 masterpiece, I always wondered what kind of Creator would create 
	 a masterpiece and then watch his masterpiece deteriorate without 
	 doing something about it.</p>
	<p class="text">I kept saying to myself, "God, I love you and I have been 
	 brought up to worship you, but I don't know anything about Isa 
	 (Jesus)." This went on for about three years. 
	 In January, 1982, 1 had started my own business. Two months 
	 later, my wife and I made an agreement to sit down and read the 
	 Bible and find out first hand who Isa is and what he has done for 
	 the human race. As we read the Bible, I was amazed to see that it 
	 is just as true as I had been told. We continued to read the 
	 Bible for several weeks and at the same time we were listening to 
	 teaching tapes about the Bible.</p>
	<p class="text">I read the Word of God in John 3:3, "Truly, truly, I say to you, 
	 unless one is born again he cannot see the Kingdom of God." Isa 
	 was simply saying that we are born of flesh and blood. However, 
	 unless we are born of the Spirit and come to know 
	 God personally, we can not see the Kingdom of God.</p>
	<p class="text">My wife and I were stirred by Romans 10 where it says"if you 
	 confess with your mouth Isa as Lord and believe in your heart 
	 that God raised him from the dead, you shall be saved." Right at 
	 that point my wife and I knew that in our hearts a change was 
	 taking place. Until then I did not know of any way to change our 
	 sinful nature and to be acceptable to God without trying to earn 
	 a right standing by being religious. I knew that God was speaking 
	 to us, but I was confused.</p>
	<p class="text">Then it was as if God was speaking to my heart and saying, "You 
	 are not denying anything, you are believing in the Name of my 
	 Word, Isa al-Masih, whom I have sent into the world so that the 
	 world may be set free from sin. I have done this because I love 
	 the people, mankind, whom I have created."</p>
	<p class="text">It was then that my wife and I made up our minds to believe. And 
	 right at that time, I could feel the joy of the Lord grasping  my 
	 whole body as I realized that Isa had gone down to the pit to pay 
	 for our sins there and to carry away our sicknesses and diseases. 
	 Then we started reading the Bible regularly, listening to 
	 teaching tapes and not only reading and hearing the Word of God, 
	 but also making the decision to do the Word of God the way God 
	 said it and to live in it so that we could receive from God in 
	 the manner he had intended for us to receive from him. 
	 Then so many good things started happening to us. My wife got 
	 healed from kidney problems, from swelling and from foot problems 
	 after we prayed in the Name of Isa and believed that God's 
	 healing was for us.</p>
	<p class="text">As we continued to read the Bible we actually came closer and 
	 closer to God. We learned how to overcome problems by finding the 
	 answer and the promise and claiming it in his Word. Consequently, 
	 both our bodies and business have been blessed by the Lord. Not 
	 only that, but God has purified us by the study of his Word, so 
	 that instead of arguments and selfishness there has been peace 
	 and love in our home.</p>
	<p class="text">The Bible says that God has made Isa al-Masih our redemption, 
	 sanctification, righteousness, and wisdom. When you know that he 
	 is all this for us, you not only have the peace of the assurance 
	 of your salvation, you also can overcome all things that come 
	 against you.</p>
	<p class="text">For example, my Muslim friend, Mehmet, had just had brain surgery 
	 not long ago to remove a cancerous tumor. He was dying. He was 
	 sad. He was fearful. He didn't want to die, and he didn't think 
	 that God really wanted to take him at the age of 32. When I first 
	 ran into him, he told me that he was dying and he was so sad. I 
	 looked at him and I told him "Jesus can heal you." His response 
	 was "Who is that?"</p>
	<p class="text">After a while we got together, and I started sharing with 
	 him from the Word of God. I told him that Jesus had died for him, 
	 that Isa was sent to this world for his sake to set him free, 
	 that God was calling all people to Him through his Word Isa, and 
	 that when we believe in his Name, we can be helped through every 
	 trial that befalls us.</p>
	<p class="text">Mehmet could not make the commitment right away. He was raised in 
	 a Muslim home and it took a while for the word of God to sink in. 
	 But as we shared, Mehmet started feeling inside of him that the 
	 Scriptures I showed him were the Word of God. He believed that 
	 somehow the truth could set him free. He finally said that he 
	 wanted to receive Isa as his Saviour so that Isa the Word of 
	 <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  would reign supreme in his heart. He did. 
	 Several weeks later, when doctors examined him, he was completely 
	 healed.<a class="note" href="notes.html#N261">261</a></p>
	<p class="text">Miraculously healed with no evidence of cancer being left behind! 
	 Now Mehmet had the joy; his face was shining with joy and with 
	 glory and with the happiness that comes from knowing the Lord. 
	 When I ran into him again, all he could talk about was how good 
	 God is, how good his Word Isa is, and how he had been set free by 
	 believing in the Name of Jesus.</p>
	<p class="text">I recently submitted to God by obeying him regarding the sibghat 
	 <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  and was immersed as He commands. This simple act signifies 
	 that my old life without him was buried in the water and my new 
	 life (and he is the source of that life) has been raised again 
	 with him as he made me a new person, a new creation, a Khalq 
	 Jadeed Muslim. Since I have obeyed the Lord in this, in taking 
	 the sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> , I have felt closer to God and closer to His 
	 Word. The sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  (baptism of God) is a simple remembrance 
	 of the death and resurrection of Isa al-Masih. Every time I 
	 remember that day and that simple act, I remember that I am set 
	 free from all the bondages and all the shortcomings of this world 
	 through the overcoming power I have in Isa al-Masih. 
	 My prayer is that other Muslims like Mehmet and I will 
	 inquire of the Word of God and receive Isa as the Word 
	 of God so that they too will receive the priceless joy and the 
	power that overcomes the world. Amen.</p>
