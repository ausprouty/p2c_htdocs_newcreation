	<p class="poem">Are you like our father Ibrahim (Abraham)?</p>
	<p class="poem">When three men came to his dwelling,</p>
	<p class="poem">Ibrahim could see who they really were</p>
	<p class="poem">--angels in disguise.</p>
	<p class="poem">So even though his wife laughed like a kafir (dis-believer),</p>
	<p class="poem"> our father Ibrahim</p>
	<p class="poem">opened his heart</p>
	<p class="poem">to their message. <a id="R1" class="note" href="soil_split_015.html#N1">1</a></p>
	<p class="poem">Ibrahim not only recognized the truth</p>
	<p class="poem">but he also fearlessly welcomed it.</p>
