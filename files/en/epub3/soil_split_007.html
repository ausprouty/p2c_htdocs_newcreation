<h2 class="subtitle" id="calibre_pb_6">THE YOUNGER SON FORSAKES ALL PRIDE AND SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2>

	<p class="poem">He finally came to himself</p>
	<p class="poem">and started thinking like an 'aqli (rational) being,</p>
	<p class="poem">like a true son having the disposition of his father.</p>
	<p class="poem">He said, "How many hired servants of my father's household abound</p>
	<p class="poem">in food and I perish with hunger!</p>
	<p class="poem">I will arise and stop straying from fasaqa (the right course) and</p>
	<p class="poem">go to my father,</p>
	<p class="poem">and I will say to him,</p>
	<p class="poem">"Father, I have sinned against heaven</p>
	<p class="poem">and in the presence of you.</p>
	<p class="poem">And I no longer think I am worthy to be called your son:</p>
	<p class="poem">make me not like my elder brother who thinks himself worthy but</p>
	<p class="poem">make me like one of your hired servants."</p>
	<p class="poem">Then he arose and came to his father.</p>
