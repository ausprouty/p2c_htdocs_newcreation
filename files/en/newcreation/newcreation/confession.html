	<h1 class = "title">THE NEW CREATION CONFESSION (KALIMAH)</h1>
	<p class="poem">Did you know</p>
	<p class="poem">that you must be made a new creation</p>
	<p class="poem">by the personal Spirit of <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>?</p>
	<p class="poem">Many people do not know this is true but it is.</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa who is the Truth says so <a  id = "R154" class = "note" href = "#N154">154</a></p>
	<p class="poem">You must be spiritually formed and recreated</p>
	<p class="poem">in the resurrection life he manifested</p>
	<p class="poem">when Isa the Word of <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">defeated death and rose from the grave.</p>
	<p class="poem">This new creation that Isa insists on</p>
	<p class="poem">is not something you can live without.</p>
	<p class="poem">Nor can you avoid making a choice.</p>
	<p class="poem">You yourself will choose</p>
	<p class="poem">either by accepting, rejecting, or neglecting</p>
	<p class="poem">the Spiritual new birth</p>
	<p class="poem">and thereby you will choose your eternal destiny.</p>
	<p class="poem">There are two human races in the world:</p>
	<p class="poem">one that has been born only once</p>
	<p class="poem">and is moving toward</p>
	<p class="poem">eternal divine separation and death;</p>
	<p class="poem">and the other that has been born twice</p>
	<p class="poem">and is moving toward eternal communion <a  id = "R155" class = "note" href = "#N155">155</a> and peace</p>
	<p class="poem">and joy in the Eternal Spirit.</p>
	<p class="poem">You must be born from the one race into the other.</p>
	<p class="poem">You must be born again.</p>
	<p class="poem">The human race was created to be perfect</p>
	<p class="poem">and to reflect a perfect God.</p>
	<p class="poem">But the whole family of man has broken God's laws</p>
	<p class="poem">and has warped itself into a sinful disposition.<a  id = "R156" class = "note" href = "#N156">156</a></p>
	<p class="poem">Fulfilling the desires</p>
	<p class="poem">of the old nature and of the old mind,</p>
	<p class="poem">we are naturally culpable,</p>
	<p class="poem">alienated and headed for judgment.</p>
	<p class="poem">We need the new birth and the new life</p>
	<p class="poem">of holy fellowship (zamala) in God's Risen Word Jesus (Isa) in</p>
	<p class="poem">order than we may become spiritually alive.</p>
	<p class="poem">The true path of life</p>
	<p class="poem">is the path God has given us.</p>
	<p class="poem">The Word of God (Isa)</p>
	<p class="poem">did something in love on our behalf:</p>
	<p class="poem">he mercifully took his own Death Judgment against us</p>
	<p class="poem">upon himself.</p>
	<p class="poem">Then he destroyed the power of death</p>
	<p class="poem">by conquering the grave even as he died in our place.</p>
	<p class="poem">Whoever says this is not true is lying</p>
	<p class="poem">and is being seduced by a powerful delusion.</p>
	<p class="poem">The wisdom of such a one</p>
	<p class="poem">is not from above</p>
	<p class="poem">but is earthly, sensual, devilish. <a  id = "R157" class = "note" href = "#N157">157</a></p>
	<p class="poem">But if you allow the truth</p>
	<p class="poem">to touch your heart deeply,</p>
	<p class="poem">and if you believe this truth in your heart</p>
	<p class="poem">and confess this truth with your lips,</p>
	<p class="poem">you will begin the pilgrimage of true life.</p>
	<p class="poem">What is next is thrilling and wonderful:</p>
	<p class="poem">we confess this truth before the true believers</p>
	<p class="poem">and we begin to digest and to enact this truth</p>
	<p class="poem">with our body and our whole being,</p>
	<p class="poem">and we follow this truth</p>
	<p class="poem">and study this truth</p>
	<p class="poem">with God's people forever.</p>
	<p class="poem">Then what finally happens?</p>
	<p class="poem">The Truth himself (Isa) takes us</p>
	<p class="poem">from glory to glory.</p>
	<p class="poem">Praise God! Subhan <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>!</p>
	<p class="poem">HOW DOES ONE MAKE OUR KALIMAH OR CONFESSION?</p>
	<p class="poem">But how does one become</p>
	<p class="poem">a new creation Muslim</p>
	<p class="poem">with Isa alive in one's life?</p>
	<p class="poem">Only by faith in the Word of <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>.</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa declared that the whole Book</p>
	<p class="poem">spoke of nothing but his coming.<a  id = "R158" class = "note" href = "#N158">158</a></p>
	<p class="poem">And, true it is,</p>
	<p class="poem">that Isa is the central theme of the true Kitab</p>
	<p class="poem">and the focus of all our revelation of eternal life.</p>
	<p class="poem">What other man is the Word of eternal life of <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>?</p>
	<p class="poem">Who but the death-conquering eternal Word in person</p>
	<p class="poem">could say convincingly:</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;I am the way, the truth, and the (eternal) life;</p>
	<p class="poem">no man comes to <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>but through me&quot;? <a  id = "R159" class = "note" href = "#N159">159</a></p>
	<p class="poem">Isa declared emphatically</p>
	<p class="poem">that just as <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  has eternal life in himself</p>
	<p class="poem">so he has granted his Word to have eternal life in himself;<a  id = "R160" class = "note" href = "#N160">160</a></p>
	<p class="poem">for his Word is his heir</p>
	<p class="poem">to whom <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  has given all authority</p>
	<p class="poem">and power and dominion to judge and to rule</p>
	<p class="poem">the new holy age dawning in his light.</p>
	<p class="poem">But only those in whom Isa is living</p>
	<p class="poem">have new creation eyes and heart</p>
	<p class="poem">with which to see and receive the truth of Isa,</p>
	<p class="poem">truth inscribed in the written Word of God.</p>
	<p class="poem">Either literally</p>
	<p class="poem">or in prophetic foreshadowings</p>
	<p class="poem">or symbols,</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa and his truth are on every page</p>
	<p class="poem">of the infallibly accurate Kitab (Book).</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa is the Word of God</p>
	<p class="poem">and only his Words inspired by the Eternal Spirit</p>
	<p class="poem">are the true words of Scripture.</p>
	<p class="poem">If this is the truth,</p>
	<p class="poem">why then does not everyone believe it?</p>
	<p class="poem">Because the man without the Eternal Spirit of <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">does not accept the words</p>
	<p class="poem">that come from the Eternal Spirit of God, <a id = "R161" class = "note" href = "#N161">161</a></p>
	<p class="poem">and no one can say that Isa</p>
	<p class="poem">is the personal, eternal, divine Word</p>
	<p class="poem">of God's Judgment</p>
	<p class="poem">without the aid of the Eternal Spirit.<a id = "R162" class = "note" href = "#N162">162</a></p>
	<p class="poem">No one can say that &quot;there is no deity but God</p>
	<p class="poem">and that Isa is the Word of God&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">without the aid of the Eternal Spirit.</p>
	<p class="poem">The natural man,</p>
	<p class="poem">even if he is religious</p>
	<p class="poem">or great by the measure of natural men,</p>
	<p class="poem">has no taste for the saving Word Isa</p>
	<p class="poem">spiritually discerned in the written Word of God.</p>
	<p class="poem">This natural and unregenerated man</p>
	<p class="poem">has received a different kitab (book)</p>
	<p class="poem">and a different salvation message</p>
	<p class="poem">and a different Jesus (Isa) <a id = "R163" class = "note" href = "#N163">163</a>.</p>
	<p class="poem">But the true Kitab plainly says</p>
	<p class="poem">that if any man comes</p>
	<p class="poem">bringing a different salvation message</p>
	<p class="poem">let him be eternally condemned to hell <a id = "R164" class = "note" href = "#N164">164</a></p>
	<p class="poem">There are many imitations of Isa</p>
	<p class="poem">that men in their cunning have preached.</p>
	<p class="poem">But the only true Isa</p>
	<p class="poem">is the one revealed in the infallible Word</p>
	<p class="poem">once for all delivered to the people who belong to God.</p>
	<p class="poem">No man can add to this revelation</p>
	<p class="poem">and no man can take away from it.</p>
	<p class="poem">It is imperishable and unchangeable.</p>
	<p class="poem">Therefore, you must discern the true words of Isa.</p>
	<p class="poem">And you must see Isa truly</p>
	<p class="poem">in the true words of prophecy.</p>
	<p class="poem">These immortal words</p>
	<p class="poem">were given by revelation</p>
	<p class="poem">through the personal Spirit of <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">to those men of old who knew</p>
	<p class="poem">personally the ever-living Word of God</p>
	<p class="poem">even before the divine Word put on human form</p>
	<p class="poem">as Isa al-Masih.<a id = "R165" class = "note" href = "#N165">165</a></p>
	<p class="poem">In the prophets <a id = "R166" class = "note" href = "#N166">166</a></p>
	<p class="poem">God had promised salvation</p>
	<p class="poem">to all those who looked when they prayed</p>
	<p class="poem">toward the direction <a id = "R167" class = "note" href = "#N167">167</a> .</p>
	<p class="poem">where His Name would dwell.</p>
	<p class="poem">The Name of God in Scripture</p>
	<p class="poem">is his personal self-disclosure,</p>
	<p class="poem">and God discloses himself by His Word.</p>
	<p class="poem">God had promised that His Word</p>
	<p class="poem">would meet with the people</p>
	<p class="poem">and tabernacle among them</p>
	<p class="poem">in the power of the Eternal Spirit.</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa is that Word.</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa is that Name.</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa is that tent of meeting with God in the desert ofthis world,</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa is that moveable pilgrim's feast,</p>
	<p class="poem">that spiritual bread of display,</p>
	<p class="poem">the one who came down from heaven</p>
	<p class="poem">that all men might digest who he is</p>
	<p class="poem">and live forever.</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa is that mysterious lampstand</p>
	<p class="poem">and that light of the niche (mishkat-ul-anwar)</p>
	<p class="poem">that lights up the dead, dark hearts of men.</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa is the Covenant Word of Eternal Life.</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa is the pilgrim's acceptable sacrifice.</p>
	<p class="poem">Sin led to the destruction</p>

	<p class="poem">When we New Creation Muslims confess the saving truth</p>
	<p class="poem">in our New Creation Id ul-Adha service,</p>
	<p class="poem">our worship is more than mere lip service</p>
	<p class="poem">or an empty religious ritual.</p>
	<p class="poem">When we eat and drink in the Id ul-Adha of Isa,</p>
	<p class="poem">we are renewing</p>

	<p class="poem">his unchangeable contractual pledge</p>
	<p class="poem">that constitutes the basis of our salvation.</p>
	<p class="poem">THE ID UL-ADHA EXPLAINED</p>
	<p class="poem">It says in the Qur'an</p>
	<p class="poem">that if a pilgrim is prevented</p>
	<p class="poem">from completing the Hajj (Pilgrimage),</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;send an offering</p>
	<p class="poem">for sacrifice.&quot;<a  id = "R172" class = "note" href = "#N172">172</a></p>
	<p class="poem">At the climax of the Hajj,</p>
	<p class="poem">a sacrificial meal is eaten</p>
	<p class="poem">that remembers the God</p>
	<p class="poem">who has been faithful to us since</p>
	<p class="poem">the days of Ibrahim,</p>
	<p class="poem">when God ransomed Ibrahim's heir</p>
	<p class="poem">with a &quot;momentous sacrifice.&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">Id ul-Adha is the &quot;Feast of Sacrifice&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">when pilgrims remember</p>
	<p class="poem">the act of divine mercy of <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> to Ibrahim.</p>
	<p class="poem">All over the world,</p>
	<p class="poem">a joyful feast of recollection is held</p>
	<p class="poem">simultaneously at the time of the hajj (pilgrimage).</p>
	<p class="poem">To remember God's mercy to Ibrahim</p>
	<p class="poem">with a &quot;more lively remembrance&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">is the intention of the feast.</p>
	<p class="poem">Not only in Mina (near Mecca),</p>
	<p class="poem">but universally and corporately,</p>
	<p class="poem">all the believers are to become pilgrims in spirit</p>
	<p class="poem">by joining in the meal wherever they are.</p>
	<p class="poem">Their purpose is to achieve not merely a remembrance</p>
	<p class="poem">but a corporate identity</p>
	<p class="poem">as a worshiping community (ummah).</p>
	<p class="poem">The pilgrims who offer the sacrificial sheep</p>
	<p class="poem">or other animal have read this saying:</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;It is not their meat</p>

	<p class="poem">The angry wrath of God against injustice must be appeased, and</p>

	<p class="poem">A real victim must experience real death,<a  id = "R184" class = "note" href = "#N184">184</a></p>

	<p class="poem">There were no images in the room</p>

	<p class="poem">His name was Talut or Saul</p>
	<p class="poem">because he had been named after King Saul</p>
	<p class="poem">and was from the same tribe.</p>
	<p class="poem">Saul was a great Jewish mullah,</p>
	<p class="poem">a great learned man so zealous in his religious knowledge</p>
	<p class="poem">that he persecuted all those who said that they</p>

	<p class="poem">It was then that Saul began a series of religious pilgrimages</p>

	<p class="poem">To show that the Good News is not based on</p>

	<p class="poem">He did not deserve a mullah's honorific position.</p>
	<p class="poem">He deserved no place of honor in the Lord's house.</p>
	<p class="poem">Yet God exalted his ministry the most</p>

	<p class="poem">Why was this proof so important to Paul?</p>
	<p class="poem">Because he knew that traditions were not the issue</p>

	<p class="poem">It says in Genesis 22:6</p>
	<p class="poem">that the son of Ibrahim</p>
	<p class="poem">carried the wood for the sacrifice,</p>
	<p class="poem">just as later Isa the son of Ibrahim</p>

	<p class="poem">And the angel of the Lord</p>

	<p class="poem">and neither can these religious symbols save us.</p>
	<p class="poem">They passed through the Sea</p>
	<p class="poem">and so they all received a death ghusl initiation</p>
	<p class="poem">into the ummah of Musa in cloud and sea.</p>
	<p class="poem">This water prefigured the death ghusl</p>
	<p class="poem">through which you are now also delivered to safety.</p>
	<p class="poem">This wudu of Isa is not the washing away of bodily uncleanness</p>
	<p class="poem">but rather it is the obedient appeal to God</p>

are an unbeliever in God's Word Isa, no matter in which  direction 
you pray, &quot;let not that man think that he shall  receive anything 
of the Lord!' (James 1:7).&nbsp; John 4:20-24 shows that  since God is 
a Spirit, direction or place in themselves are not  crucial. 
Knowing God is all-important.&nbsp; God cannot be known  apart from His 
Word and Isa is His Word. <a class = "return" href = "#R167"> (&nbsp;Return&nbsp;) </a>
