<h2 class="subtitle" id="calibre_pb_16">THE TARIQA (WAY) FOR NEW CREATION MUSLIMS</h2>
	<p class="poem">Shaitan (the Devil) is ultimately not able</p>
	<p class="poem">to overpower a person</p>
	<p class="poem">who is on the right path.</p>
	<p class="poem">The beginning of the right path is the living Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>,</p>
	<p class="poem">not a paper book sent down to be worshiped as a fetish,</p>
	<p class="poem">but a living personal Word sent down</p>
	<p class="poem">that we might have life</p>
	<p class="poem">and have it more abundantly</p>
	<p class="poem">through a new and living tariqa (way)</p>
	<p class="poem">found only in Isa's inerrant written words.</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa said, "I am the tariqa (the right path),</p>
	<p class="poem">the haqiqah (truth),</p>
	<p class="poem">and the hayat (life).</p>
	<p class="poem">No one comes to the Father</p>
	<p class="poem">but by me"</p>
	<p class="poem">(there is no other mediator,</p>
	<p class="poem">no prophet who can supercede him,</p>
	<p class="poem">no other name under heaven</p>
	<p class="poem">whereby we must be saved).</p>
	<p class="poem">The center of the right path is Iman (right Faith)</p>
	<p class="poem">not in a righteousness of our own</p>
	<p class="poem">which is of law-keeping and works,</p>
	<p class="poem">nor of din (religious practice) nor ihsan (rightdoing),</p>
	<p class="poem">but that which is through iman (faith) in the Word himself,</p>
	<p class="poem">who comes to us from <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  in the power of the Spirit</p>
	<p class="poem">both to will and to do his good pleasure,</p>
	<p class="poem">effecting in us a righteousness which is of God</p>
	<p class="poem">by faith and not by works,</p>
	<p class="poem">lest anyone should boast.</p>
	<p class="poem">The beginning of the way through is tawba (repentance).</p>
	<p class="poem">This means continually confessing and putting to death</p>
	<p class="poem">what is prone toward evil within us,</p>
	<p class="poem">that is, the qalb (heart) of a fasiq (sinner).</p>
	<p class="poem">If we say we have no sin,</p>
	<p class="poem">we deceive ourselves</p>
	<p class="poem">and the truth is not in us.</p>
	<p class="poem">If we confess our sins,</p>
	<p class="poem">he is faithful and just</p>
	<p class="poem">to forgive our sins,</p>
	<p class="poem">and to cleanse us</p>
	<p class="poem">from all unrighteousness.</p>
	<p class="poem">The inclination of all humanity</p>
	<p class="poem">not individually necessitated by <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">but nevertheless personally and freely chosen</p>
	<p class="poem">by all Adam's children--</p>
	<p class="poem">is to sin and therefore to die.</p>
	<p class="poem">Thus, we must die to self (al-Junaid-fana).</p>
	<p class="poem">We need to put to death in ourselves that which</p>
	<p class="poem">shares the same sin-prone nature as the old mankind</p>
	<p class="poem">(we need to die to the umma, community, of Adam),</p>
	<p class="poem">and we must be recreated by the Word of God</p>
	<p class="poem">(we need to be born anew</p>
	<p class="poem">into the spiritual ummah of the Word of God).</p>
	<p class="poem">The mystery of the right path</p>
	<p class="poem">is that the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">who is the likeness of the invisible God (Col.1:15),</p>
	<p class="poem">became al-Insan al-Kamil (the Perfect Man) Isa al-Masih</p>
	<p class="poem">and died a death to cure the guilt</p>
	<p class="poem">of the qalb (heart) of every fasiq (sinner),</p>
	<p class="poem">so that we can become assured</p>
	<p class="poem">of our eternal inheritance as new creations,</p>
	<p class="poem">being daily renewed and perfected.</p>
	<p class="poem">This mystery is the temporary secret of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">now made publicly known,</p>
	<p class="poem">that is, that Isa al-Masih</p>
	<p class="poem">is the past, present and future pattern of mankind,</p>
	<p class="poem">and whatever utopia or myth men hope for is unreal</p>
	<p class="poem">except as the real is seen in Him alive from the dead.</p>
	<p class="poem">The center of the way through is inaba (returning)</p>
	<p class="poem">to al-Insan al-Kamil (the Perfect Man).</p>
	<p class="poem">To as many as received him (Isa)</p>
	<p class="poem">to them gave he power to become the heirs of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> ,</p>
	<p class="poem">and we know that when he shall appear</p>
	<p class="poem">we shall be like him.</p>
	<p class="poem">The end of the way through is to submit</p>
	<p class="poem">in total obedience to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">in the marifah (knowledge)</p>
	<p class="poem">of His costly and holy ishq (love)</p>
	<p class="poem">with which He has loved us,</p>
	<p class="poem">even with the love of a Father.</p>
	<p class="poem">This is the love God has for us,</p>
	<p class="poem">the same fatherly love He had for Ibrahim</p>
	<p class="poem">(whose former name Abram means 'Exalted Father').</p>
	<p class="poem">Ibrahim himself returned this type of love to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">by his willingness to sacrifice to God</p>
	<p class="poem">his only heir.</p>
	<p class="poem">The end of the right path</p>
	<p class="poem">is daily to do the al-arkan (right duties)</p>
	<p class="poem">by the direction and empowering of the Eternal Spirit.</p>
	<p class="poem">This step is ubudiyah (service)</p>
	<p class="poem">and cannot be done by might</p>
	<p class="poem">nor by power,</p>
	<p class="poem">but by His Eternal Spirit.</p>
