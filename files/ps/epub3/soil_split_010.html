	<p class="poem">Presently the elder brother</p>
	<p class="poem">thought he saw another servant approaching.</p>
	<p class="poem">But it was really his father</p>
	<p class="poem">coming to give him a personal word <a class="note" id="R5" href="soil_split_015.html#N5">5</a></p>
	<p class="poem">in order that the elder son could start thinking</p>
	<p class="poem">like an 'aqli (rational) being</p>
	<p class="poem">and enter into the spirit of the whole jam'a'a (house).</p>
	<p class="poem">So his father pleaded with him.</p>
	<p class="poem">Finally the elder son answered the man:</p>
	<p class="poem">"Look, all these years I have submitted (islam) <a class="note" id="R6" href="soil_split_015.html#N6">6</a></p>
	<p class="poem">to you as an abd (slave)</p>
	<p class="poem">and I can boast without shame that</p>
	<p class="poem">I have religiously obeyed all of the shari'a (laws)</p>
	<p class="poem">of this whole jam'a'a (house).</p>
	<p class="poem">Yet I return from the mosque</p>
	<p class="poem">and I hear the sounds of the wisal (conununion)</p>
	<p class="poem">between you and this mufarrit (prodigal)!</p>
	<p class="poem">Am I now to humble myself</p>
	<p class="poem">and enter a house with this sort of zamala (fellowship)?"</p>
