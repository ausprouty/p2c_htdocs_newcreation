<h2 class="subtitle" id="calibre_pb_14">THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD, EVEN THE RELIGIOUS PEOPLE, ARE LIKE AN ADULTEROUS WIFE</h2>
	<p class="poem">The adulterous wife of the man of God</p>
	<p class="poem">might speak of God in passionate terms</p>
	<p class="poem">as she might speak of her husband,</p>
	<p class="poem">but her rebellious heart was always sneaking off</p>
	<p class="poem">after that which really excited her.</p>
	<p class="poem">No, it was no part of her religious experience</p>
	<p class="poem">to ever feel caught in shame before the believers</p>
	<p class="poem">or to feel guilty of sin before God.</p>
	<p class="poem">Her reasoning was that she was no worse than any one else.</p>
	<p class="poem">Besides, she thought, couldn't she always do good</p>
	<p class="poem">to counterbalance her sins?</p>
	<p class="poem">She never thought of herself</p>
	<p class="poem">as having a "fallen nature."</p>
	<p class="poem">And since God did not seem close at hand</p>
	<p class="poem">to catch her in this treacherous state,</p>
	<p class="poem">this adulterous nature,</p>
	<p class="poem">this unregenerate whorish heart,</p>
	<p class="poem">she never felt a guilty dissatisfaction</p>
	<p class="poem">with her own unspiritual self.</p>
	<p class="poem">Nor did she ever feel a burning need</p>
	<p class="poem">for a clean, new creation nature.</p>
	<p class="poem">Just a bit more religion would do the trick, she thought.</p>
	<p class="poem">For when she was with her co-religionists</p>
	<p class="poem">involved in religion,</p>
	<p class="poem">she could see she seemed to be at least</p>
	<p class="poem">as good as those who did</p>
	<p class="poem">her same supposedly merit-earning religious rituals.</p>
	<p class="poem">Some people have no sense of shame.</p>
	<p class="poem">They do not ask the question,</p>
	<p class="poem">"Who can rescue me from this rebel nature?"</p>
	<p class="poem">They do not ask,</p>
	<p class="poem">"How can I become a muslim (true submitter) to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">and receive a new creation nature?"</p>
	<p class="poem">They are like this woman,</p>
	<p class="poem">without a sense of being caught in shame before a holy God,</p>
	<p class="poem">a God who finds you guilty in your very nature,</p>
	<p class="poem">not just in your sins</p>
	<p class="poem">--a God who wants to give you a new holy nature,</p>
	<p class="poem">one that has an effecting will not to sin;</p>
	<p class="poem">with his Eternal Spirit giving you</p>
	<p class="poem">the tender conscience of His Word.</p>
	<p class="poem">But you say, "I am not like her.</p>
	<p class="poem">I don't commit adultery.</p>
	<p class="poem">I don't need a new nature."</p>
	<p class="poem">Have you ever looked with lust at another person?</p>
	<p class="poem">Don't you know that such looks</p>
	<p class="poem">come out of an adulterous heart?</p>
	<p class="poem">Don't you know that God wants to give you</p>
	<p class="poem">a new spiritual heart,</p>
	<p class="poem">one that recoils in revulsion at even the thought of sin,</p>
	<p class="poem">a heart where the mind of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  Himself is mindful?</p>
	<p class="poem">Stop being satisfied with your unspiritual self</p>
	<p class="poem">disguised under robe upon robe of religion!</p>
	<p class="poem">Don't you know that you too must become a new creation?</p>
	<p class="poem">Those who do supposedly merit-earning religious rituals</p>
	<p class="poem">without a new creation nature from <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> ,</p>
	<p class="poem">and think they are pleasing <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> ,</p>
	<p class="poem">are going to be eternally surprised.</p>
	<p class="poem">Somewhere He has called</p>
	<p class="poem">such religious people "an abomination" <a id="R61" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N61">61</a>.</p>
	<p class="poem">Unless your righteousness exceeds people like this,</p>
	<p class="poem">you will not enter the Kingdom of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> .<a id="R62" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N62">62</a></p>
	<p class="poem">For God is a covenant-loyal God,</p>
	<p class="poem">a faithful and a holy husband,</p>
	<p class="poem">but the people who are not a new creation</p>
	<p class="poem">and are merely religious</p>
	<p class="poem">are to Him those who have an adulterous heart worthy of hell.</p>
	<p class="poem">They have the nature of a rebellious wife that makes God angry.</p>
	<p class="poem">For the burning lake of hell fire and brimstone</p>
	<p class="poem">is reserved for these:</p>
	<p class="poem">those who claim to believe</p>
	<p class="poem">but who are offended when persecution comes,</p>
	<p class="poem">those who are untrustworthy in holding forth the true witness,</p>
	<p class="poem">those who are morally unclean in any way</p>
	<p class="poem">or detestably idolatrous,</p>
	<p class="poem">those with murderous hatred in their hearts,</p>
	<p class="poem">those who are sensually fixated</p>
	<p class="poem">or practice sex disallowed by <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> ,</p>
	<p class="poem">those involved in magic charms,</p>
	<p class="poem">degraded religion or the occult,</p>
	<p class="poem">those who are covetously idolatrous or consult false prophets,</p>
	<p class="poem">those who do not live and tell the truth. (Revelation21:8)</p>
	<p class="poem">God takes no pleasure in the torment of the wicked in hell,</p>
	<p class="poem">and neither does a true prophet</p>
	<p class="poem">take pleasure in the death of the wicked.</p>
	<p class="poem">Who can preach these things without tears?</p>
	<p class="poem">Yet they must be proclaimed,</p>
	<p class="poem">for how can any be saved from destruction</p>
	<p class="poem">without a new creation nature spoken into existence</p>
	<p class="poem">by the living and eternal Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> ?</p>
	<p class="poem">Please understand that the intention</p>
	<p class="poem">is not to demean anyone,</p>
	<p class="poem">but to awaken everyone and see everyone delivered</p>
	<p class="poem">from the coming fury and the anguish that is forever.</p>
	<p class="poem">We treat all people with reverence and humility,</p>
	<p class="poem">and we discern in them some vestige of the image of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> ,</p>
	<p class="poem">not entirely faded, even from the vilest.</p>
	<p class="poem">For a glimmer of the goodness of the God who made him</p>
	<p class="poem">still shines from every man,</p>
	<p class="poem">making all accountable when,</p>
	<p class="poem">even though they hear,</p>
	<p class="poem">they refuse to obey the Word.</p>
	<p class="poem">We treat all people with reverence,</p>
	<p class="poem">knowing that the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  himself</p>
	<p class="poem">thought every soul worth dying for</p>
	<p class="poem">and has ascended to the right hand of God</p>
	<p class="poem">where He is the universal Leader</p>
	<p class="poem">of our congregational prayers,</p>
	<p class="poem">our Imam (Leader),</p>
	<p class="poem">who makes intercession for the elect.</p>
	<p class="poem">And how can we be irreverent toward one</p>
	<p class="poem">about whom our Imam, Isa the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> ,</p>
	<p class="poem">may Himself be interceding?</p>
	<p class="poem">Oh the depth of the riches</p>
	<p class="poem">both of the wisdom and power of God!</p>
	<p class="poem">Our God is a consuming fire!</p>
	<p class="poem">As His salvation is endless</p>
	<p class="poem">so is His just judgment of torment for the wicked!</p>
	<p class="poem">If you feel absolutely no shame or guilt before God,</p>
	<p class="poem">not just because of the sin you have done,</p>
	<p class="poem">but because of the sinner you are by nature,</p>
	<p class="poem">then you may rest assured</p>
	<p class="poem">that you are like the woman in this true story.</p>
	<p class="poem">Why?</p>
	<p class="poem">Because she feels exactly like you,</p>
	<p class="poem">without shame or guilt before God.</p>
	<p class="poem">For her, merit-earning religious ritual is enough,</p>
	<p class="poem">because she has a corrupt mind and counterfeit faith,</p>
	<p class="poem">having seared the tender conscience</p>
	<p class="poem">the Eternal Spirit would give her.</p>
	<p class="poem">She presumptuously thinks she can live any way she wants,</p>
	<p class="poem">without a new nature,</p>
	<p class="poem">and be continually forgiven as</p>
	<p class="poem">she salutes a few religious rules</p>
	<p class="poem">yet remains in her unregenerate, rebellious state.</p>
	<p class="poem">Are you going to be like her?</p>
	<p class="poem">--Not guilty or shameful enough</p>
	<p class="poem">to feel the need for a new creation nature?</p>
	<p class="poem">She thinks <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  will be pleased with her when she dies.</p>
	<p class="poem">But that day will not mean what she thinks.</p>
	<p class="poem">It will be a day of darkness and not light.</p>
	<p class="poem">This deluded woman thinks her life is her own</p>
	<p class="poem">to do with according to a few religious rules</p>
	<p class="poem">(which she secretly breaks from time to time)</p>
	<p class="poem">and she's very happy with herself</p>
	<p class="poem">and with the rules she agrees to go by</p>
	<p class="poem">and with the life she has made for herself,</p>
	<p class="poem">with the life she has found for herself.</p>
	<p class="poem">But whoever finds his life</p>
	<p class="poem">will lose it;</p>
	<p class="poem">Whoever loses his life</p>
	<p class="poem">and receives the gift of a new creation nature</p>
	<p class="poem">will find his life again</p>
	<p class="poem">and keep it for eternity.</p>
	<p class="poem">Does not the very honor of the husband</p>
	<p class="poem">require that this adulterous woman</p>
	<p class="poem">should be punished?</p>
	<p class="poem">Or should she be allowed</p>
	<p class="poem">to go on like this,</p>
	<p class="poem">smugly thinking God does not see her,</p>
	<p class="poem">even when a man of God</p>
	<p class="poem">supernaturally tells her that God can see her?</p>
	<p class="poem">Does not such ignorant stubbornness make you angry?</p>
	<p class="poem">God has given her years to repent and reform,</p>
	<p class="poem">but she has abused His patience and tolerance,</p>
	<p class="poem">refusing to own up to the fact that His goodness</p>
	<p class="poem">is meant to lead her to repentance.</p>
	<p class="poem">She thinks God is like her,</p>
	<p class="poem">and so she defiantly puts God's honor to the test.</p>
	<p class="poem">With her brainless lovers and her inexhaustible adulteries,</p>
	<p class="poem">she continually brings dishonor</p>
	<p class="poem">not only on her husband's house</p>
	<p class="poem">but also on her father's household,</p>
	<p class="poem">and even on the household of God.</p>
	<p class="poem">She and her lovers are a brood that God detests.</p>
	<p class="poem">They are one-of-a-kind with the accursed children of Adam.</p>
	<p class="poem">The first man, Adam, and his wife</p>
	<p class="poem">were attracted and satanically seduced</p>
	<p class="poem">by their own wrong desires when they believed Satan's lie</p>
	<p class="poem">that the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  is error.</p>
	<p class="poem">When they hardened their hearts against <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  and His Word,</p>
	<p class="poem">they gave birth to a breed more wicked than themselves.</p>
	<p class="poem">When they rebelled against His Word,</p>
	<p class="poem">deciding they knew more than God,</p>
	<p class="poem">they fell from the glory of His likeness.</p>
	<p class="poem">Now the human race,</p>
	<p class="poem">although it pays lip service to religion,</p>
	<p class="poem">is steeped in unrighteousness, war, wrangling, murder,</p>
	<p class="poem">depravity, maliciousness, arrogance, self-seeking,</p>
	<p class="poem">vile speech, and treachery of every sort</p>
	<p class="poem">--a community of snakes coiling around snakes!</p>
	<p class="poem">And the leaders are the worst vipers in the pit!</p>
	<p class="poem">They have hardened their hearts against the love of God,</p>
	<p class="poem">and their wicked pride shuts up all remorse for their sin. Sin?</p>
	<p class="poem">Their minds are always enterprising in it!</p>
	<p class="poem">Fierce wolves in sheep's clothing,</p>
	<p class="poem">the religious teachers</p>
	<p class="poem">publish empty dreams and lying visions</p>
	<p class="poem">that lead the Lord's lost sheep astray.</p>
	<p class="poem">Not content with that,</p>
	<p class="poem">they persecute the true shepherds</p>
	<p class="poem">and murderously eat the flesh of the little lambs</p>
	<p class="poem">and tear off their hoofs.</p>
	<p class="poem">Don't they know that God loves people?</p>
	<p class="poem">God wants all people to know who He is</p>
	<p class="poem">and who they can become as submitters to Him!</p>
	<p class="poem">Do these sleek religious wolves know God</p>
	<p class="poem">or even care to know Him?</p>
	<p class="poem">They do not!</p>
	<p class="poem">Like Balaam's ass (that donkey prophet),</p>
	<p class="poem">they see an angel and give a message.</p>
	<p class="poem">And if even a man supported by a woman declares himself</p>
	<p class="poem">to be the Messianic Prophet,</p>
	<p class="poem">these wolves will become his fast friends</p>
	<p class="poem">and sing his praises,</p>
	<p class="poem">and want to kill anyone</p>
	<p class="poem">who disagrees with their authority to be his butchers!</p>
	<p class="poem">These false prophets preach a tinsel word,</p>
	<p class="poem">an ear-tickling word,</p>
	<p class="poem">a bloodless word</p>
	<p class="poem">that cannot save.</p>
	<p class="poem">Who is more wicked than the unregenerate prophet</p>
	<p class="poem">who will not tell the way to regeneration?</p>
	<p class="poem">They themselves will not venture out into the breach,</p>
	<p class="poem">yet these butchers pour out the blood</p>
	<p class="poem">of their own people without a qualm</p>
	<p class="poem">and even dare to do this in the name of God!</p>
	<p class="poem">Will the adulterous hypocrites who follow them</p>
	<p class="poem">not be made as guilty and ashamed</p>
	<p class="poem">as the treacherous hypocrites who lead them?</p>
	<p class="poem">Does not the very honor of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">require that this pretentious brood</p>
	<p class="poem">all be thrown into hell?</p>
	<p class="poem">Yes, a rebel prophet with a lying vision</p>
	<p class="poem">and all the rebels at heart</p>
	<p class="poem">who love to listen to lies</p>
	<p class="poem">will burn together.</p>
	<p class="poem">A darkened race!</p>
	<p class="poem">We cry out to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  when in need,</p>
	<p class="poem">but we forget Him as soon as He answers,</p>
	<p class="poem">greeting His speedy abundance</p>
	<p class="poem">with our not-long-in-coming pride.</p>
	<p class="poem">He shows us great signs and wonders,</p>
	<p class="poem">but the spiritually dense</p>
	<p class="poem">are more impressed with themselves.</p>
	<p class="poem">Be warned, you impotent leaders of the world,</p>
	<p class="poem">you set of rebels ruling rebels:</p>
	<p class="poem">submit to the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">and kiss His death-conquering feet</p>
	<p class="poem">or, despite the massive mutiny you mount against Him,</p>
	<p class="poem">the blast of His anger will be a flame</p>
	<p class="poem">you can never put out.</p>
	<p class="poem">For the furious anger of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">has been revealed from heaven</p>
	<p class="poem">against all the ungodliness of men</p>
	<p class="poem">who hold the truth down</p>
	<p class="poem">in their unrighteousness.</p>
	<p class="poem">These enemies of God claim to serve Him,</p>
	<p class="poem">but in the name of truth and religion</p>
	<p class="poem">they crucify al-Haqq (the Truth) Himself</p>
	<p class="poem">and, if possible, hold Him down forever</p>
	<p class="poem">--but it is not possible, because <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  himself</p>
	<p class="poem">has raised His Truth triumphant</p>
	<p class="poem">over death, hell and murderous false prophets!</p>
	<p class="poem">Such liars widen the mouth of hell</p>
	<p class="poem">to gulp those like them down the more,</p>
	<p class="poem">and so they cause in the land</p>
	<p class="poem">a famine</p>
	<p class="poem">of hearing the true Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> .</p>
	<p class="poem"><span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  is angry with the whole race of Adam.</p>
	<p class="poem">He has vowed such accursed children of Adam</p>
	<p class="poem">to His Word for destruction</p>
	<p class="poem">and marked them down to His Truth for public execution.</p>
	<p class="poem">Are you ignorant that <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  decreed</p>
	<p class="poem">the death and rebirth of the whole human race?</p>
	<p class="poem">Did you not know that the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  Himself</p>
	<p class="poem">brought the decree?</p>
	<p class="poem">The old race <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  nailed up naked and dying</p>
	<p class="poem">and the new race He raised up clothed in glory.</p>
	<p class="poem">The decree of death to the sinful dying race</p>
	<p class="poem">and decree of life to the glorious holy race</p>
	<p class="poem">came through the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  Isa al-Masih!</p>
	<p class="poem">Did you not know that al-Haqq (the Truth)</p>
	<p class="poem">came as Truth to bear witness to the Truth?</p>
	<p class="poem">A Roman governor (Pilate) who put Isa (Jesus) on trial</p>
	<p class="poem">asked him,</p>
	<p class="poem">"What is Truth?"</p>
	<p class="poem">This wicked soul did not know it was he who was on trial</p>
	<p class="poem">and it was the whole brood of such as he</p>
	<p class="poem">that Isa the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  would doom</p>
	<p class="poem">in His own sacrificial flesh.</p>
	<p class="poem">How, then, has God revealed his anger?</p>
	<p class="poem">God sent His flaming Word</p>
	<p class="poem">who will one day finally</p>
	<p class="poem">remove the anguished wicked from His Presence;</p>
	<p class="poem">God sent His burning, pure and sinless Word</p>
	<p class="poem">into our fallen and wicked world</p>
	<p class="poem">in a body as physical as any sinful body,</p>
	<p class="poem">in order to publicly condemn</p>
	<p class="poem">our fallen nature in the flesh.</p>
	<p class="poem">God thus summarily put to death</p>
	<p class="poem">the race of Adam,</p>
	<p class="poem">and has been replacing it</p>
	<p class="poem">with the new creation ummah (community)</p>
	<p class="poem">of the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> ,</p>
	<p class="poem">as each new believer</p>
	<p class="poem">hears, believes, repents,</p>
	<p class="poem">and is spiritually born from above to have a holy nature</p>
	<p class="poem">like that of Isa the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> .</p>
	<p class="poem">For God is not willing that any should perish.</p>
	<p class="poem">God is holding open the opportunity</p>
	<p class="poem">for many to die</p>
	<p class="poem">to their faithless life in Adam's race</p>
	<p class="poem">and to come alive</p>
	<p class="poem">to their pure and holy new life</p>
	<p class="poem">in the race of the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> .</p>
	<p class="poem">Why is the death and rebirth of the whole race of Man</p>
	<p class="poem">necessary?</p>
	<p class="poem">God could not let our sinful will go unpunished.</p>
	<p class="poem">His honor could not allow it.</p>
	<p class="poem">His justice demanded punishment</p>
	<p class="poem">for our wickedness</p>
	<p class="poem">and his honor demanded death</p>
	<p class="poem">for our sin against His holiness.</p>
	<p class="poem">However, God loves the world</p>
	<p class="poem">and, like a heart-broken husband of an adulteress</p>
	<p class="poem">wooing back his faithless wife,</p>
	<p class="poem">God by no means wants to destroy His creation.</p>
	<p class="poem">So with an open palm of heavenly reconciliation</p>
	<p class="poem">held out in the one hand,</p>
	<p class="poem">and with a fist of hellish reprisal</p>
	<p class="poem">threatening in the other,</p>
	<p class="poem">God comes to this adulterous world</p>
	<p class="poem">to get her decision:</p>
	<p class="poem">will she or will she not</p>
	<p class="poem">let Him make her into a new creation</p>
	<p class="poem">and take her back honorably,</p>
	<p class="poem">in covenant faithfulness and loyalty to Him,</p>
	<p class="poem">her death-deserving sin and its blood debt paid.</p>
	<p class="poem">He sent the Bridegroom of His Honor, His Word,</p>
	<p class="poem">to enrobe Himself in our humanity</p>
	<p class="poem">and to serve the death warrant of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">on our sinful race.</p>
	<p class="poem">This was to save the honor of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> .</p>
	<p class="poem">Then His Word came to life again</p>
	<p class="poem">to vouchsafe the promise of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> to a new forgiven humanity</p>
	<p class="poem">who would leave their old corrupt minds</p>
	<p class="poem">and receive the mind of Isa</p>
	<p class="poem">to be spiritually raised to life with him.</p>
	<p class="poem">This was to save the honor of believers.</p>
	<p class="poem">Praise be unto <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  for His Eternal Word Isa!</p>
	<p class="poem">Then, honorably unburdened of their wicked past,</p>
	<p class="poem">all those who had longed to obey the Word of God</p>
	<p class="poem">could be given the gift of a blessed future</p>
	<p class="poem">and, as new creations, could become true submitters to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> .</p>
	<p class="poem">If the honor of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">or the honor of your own life before <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">means anything to you,</p>
	<p class="poem">you can come today to the kind of godly shame</p>
	<p class="poem">and righteous sorrow for sin</p>
	<p class="poem">that leads to salvation.</p>
	<p class="poem">You can receive the living Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  through faith</p>
	<p class="poem">by calling out to Him now.</p>
	<p class="poem">You can become part of His new humanity today.</p>
	<p class="poem">But you say,</p>
	<p class="poem">"I have many questions.</p>
	<p class="poem">You have discussed evil at length;</p>
	<p class="poem">why does <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  tolerate the wicked at all?</p>
	<p class="poem">Why are they allowed to prosper?"</p>
	<p class="poem">Since the present is but a brief preparation</p>
	<p class="poem">for a more demanding future,</p>
	<p class="poem">the seeming prosperity of the wicked</p>
	<p class="poem">is really their curse,</p>
	<p class="poem">in that he who is muddled by money</p>
	<p class="poem">is ill-prepared for imminent coming judgment,</p>
	<p class="poem">and so his "prosperity" seals his doom.</p>
	<p class="poem">We are just one heart-beat away</p>
	<p class="poem">from death and eternal judgment.</p>
	<p class="poem">When we die we will become aware</p>
	<p class="poem">of standing before the judgment throne</p>
	<p class="poem">of the eternal Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">--the Word who took the judgment</p>
	<p class="poem">(by his death in our place)</p>
	<p class="poem">of those who have faith in him</p>
	<p class="poem">and forsake all boasting</p>
	<p class="poem">in dead religious works.</p>
	<p class="poem">The more wickedness a man does</p>
	<p class="poem">and the more reward he seems to acquire from it,</p>
	<p class="poem">the more lulled he is into being caught</p>
	<p class="poem">in his wicked condition,</p>
	<p class="poem">which is a state worthy of eternal damnation.</p>
