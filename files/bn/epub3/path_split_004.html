<h2 class="subtitle" id="calibre_pb_3">THE MIRACLE OCCURS</h2>
	<p class="poem">On the very night before the miracle happened,</p>
	<p class="poem">Ahmad and Isha happened to take a room in a hotel</p>
	<p class="poem">a very short distance from the place</p>
	<p class="poem">where the man of God dwelt.</p>
	<p class="poem">On the very morning</p>
	<p class="poem">when the man of God</p>
	<p class="poem">was petitioning <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  so earnestly to send more people,</p>
	<p class="poem">Isha had taken her baby for a walk</p>
	<p class="poem">and she was going down the street.</p>
	<p class="poem">She was walking along,</p>
	<p class="poem">and when she came to the building</p>
	<p class="poem">where the man of God was on his face</p>
	<p class="poem">crying out to God</p>
	<p class="poem">(even though there was no sign on the building</p>
	<p class="poem">nor any way in the world to know</p>
	<p class="poem">the man of God was inside)</p>
	<p class="poem">Isha stopped and asked a lady passer-by</p>
	<p class="poem">if she knew of any jami' (gathering)</p>
	<p class="poem">for du'a (free-prayer) in the area.</p>
	<p class="poem">The lady passer-by happened to be a murid (novice believer) who</p>
	<p class="poem">belonged to the persecuted flock of God</p>
	<p class="poem">that met in the dwelling of the man of God.</p>
	<p class="poem">Not only that,</p>
	<p class="poem">the women happened,</p>
	<p class="poem">in the providence of God,</p>
	<p class="poem">to pass each other</p>
	<p class="poem">right in front of this very house masjid (place of prayer)!</p>
	<p class="poem">"The Lord orders the steps of a righteous person"</p>
	<p class="poem">is the saying.</p>
	<p class="poem">Many err with their doctrine</p>
	<p class="poem">knowing neither the Scriptures nor the power of God,</p>
	<p class="poem">nor the love of God, which passes all understanding.</p>
	<p class="poem">What <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  foreknows He forewills</p>
	<p class="poem">"to work together for good for those</p>
	<p class="poem">who love <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> , who are called according to his purpose,"</p>
	<p class="poem">who are blessed, because they "are not offended at His Word."</p>
	<p class="poem">At this exact moment, then,</p>
	<p class="poem">just as the man of God finished his petition</p>
	<p class="poem">with the words, "Send us more people, Lord"</p>
	<p class="poem">--there was a knock on the door!</p>
	<p class="poem">The man of God had no idea who Isha was.</p>
	<p class="poem">"Do you know where my husband and I</p>
	<p class="poem">could find a congegation?" Isha asked.</p>
	<p class="poem">"Yes," the man of God said, flabbergasted.</p>
	<p class="poem">"Praise to Him," Isha said,</p>
	<p class="poem">"because we've been seeking</p>
	<p class="poem">to find a certain man of God,"</p>
	<p class="poem">and then she gave his name.</p>
	<p class="poem">"Do you know where I could find him?"</p>
	<p class="poem">"I'm he," the man of God said.</p>
	<p class="poem">"Oh..." Isha was shocked.</p>
	<p class="poem">So the man of God saw his prayer</p>
	<p class="poem">answered so suddenly and miraculously.</p>
	<p class="poem">God had led the woman to the man of God.</p>
	<p class="poem">Al-Hadi (The Guide) knew where he lived!</p>
	<p class="poem">For Al-Hadi is Al-'Alim (The All-Knowing).</p>
	<p class="poem">Right after that the congregation started to grow again,</p>
	<p class="poem">despite the opposition of the godless.</p>
	<p class="poem">And both Isha and her husband Ahmad</p>
	<p class="poem">submitted to the death ghusl</p>
	<p class="poem">of New Creation Islam in the ocean,</p>
	<p class="poem">calling on <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  to cleanse their inner being</p>
	<p class="poem">with "the wudu (washing) of tajaddud (regeneration)</p>
	<p class="poem">and the renewing of the Eternal Spirit of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> ."</p>
	<p class="poem">That was nearly ten years ago.</p>
	<p class="poem">Then the man of God moved to another place.</p>
