<p class="poem">The New Creation 'Id ul-Adha</p>
<p class="poem">is the feast of sacrifice of Ibrahim <a class = "note" href = "notes.html#N207">207</a></p>
<p class="poem">who remembered with a solemn sacrifice</p>
<p class="poem">when <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   spared his heir.</p>
<p class="poem">This celebration looked forward to Ibrahim's greatest  heir,</p>
<p class="poem">the Messiah Isa, who is the Messenger of <span  lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
</p>
<p class="poem">and his Word<a class = "note" href = "notes.html#N208">208</a></p>
<p class="poem">the one who will inherit and judge the whole world.</p>
<p class="poem">As such, Isa is the Messenger of Ibrahim's covenant  ('ahd).</p>
<p class="poem">The Messianic 'Id al-Adha commemorates</p>
<p class="poem">Isa's momentous sacrifice or beezah 'azim <a class = "note" href = "notes.html#N209">209</a></p>
<p class="poem">at the end of his pilgrimage</p>
<p class="poem">in the holy land of Ibrahim (Muqaddasa),</p>
<p class="poem">when <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   spared all his heirs</p>
<p class="poem">by providing the eternal Lamb of God</p>
<p class="poem">who takes away the sin of the world.</p>
<h2 class="subtitle">THE ETERNAL WORD OF <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
</h2>
<p class="poem">The Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   always existed</p>
<p class="poem">as the Servant (abd) of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  .</p>
<p class="poem">Before the Word took human form as Isa the Messiah</p>
<p class="poem">he was still personally existent,</p>
<p class="poem">and reflected the likeness of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
</p>
<p class="poem">as the heavenly Word of Judgment</p>
<p class="poem">whose personal name was Son of Man.<a class = "note" href = "notes.html#N210">210</a></p>
<p class="poem">He is the pre-existent Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  ,</p>
<p class="poem">his uncreated and co-eternal agent</p>
<p class="poem">in creation and redemption and judgment.</p>
<p class="poem">More than the living heavenly pattern</p>
<p class="poem">about whom the Eternal Spirit</p>
<p class="poem">inspired the true Kitab (Book) of Taurat and Injil,</p>
<p class="poem">Isa is also both the death-conquering Messenger of the  covenant</p>
<p class="poem">and the life-giving Message of the covenant.<a class = "note" href = "notes.html#N211">211</a></p>
<p class="poem">He is, in fact, the covenant.</p>
<p class="poem">The Dead Sea Scrolls incorruptibly preserve</p>
<p class="poem">the prediction of the prophet Isaiah who,</p>
<p class="poem">seven hundred years before Isa the Messiah arrived,</p>
<p class="poem">spoke of him as the covenant:</p>
<p class="poem">&quot;Behold my Servant, whom I uphold;</p>
<p class="poem">my chosen one in whom I myself delight.</p>
<p class="poem">I have put my Spirit upon him:</p>
<p class="poem">He shall bring forth judgment to the Nations</p>
<p class="poem">the islands shall wait for his law (or teaching)</p>
<p class="poem">.....I the Lord have called thee (the Servant of <span  lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  )</p>
<p class="poem">in righteousness</p>
<p class="poem">and will hold thine hand,</p>
<p class="poem">and will keep thee for a covenant of the people,</p>
<p class="poem">for a light to the Gentiles.&quot;<a class = "note" href = "notes.html#N212">212</a></p>
<p class="poem">You have heard of the saying,</p>
<p class="poem">&quot;We have already, beforehand,</p>
<p class="poem">taken the covenant ('ahida) of Adam,</p>
<p class="poem">but he forgot: and we found</p>
<p class="poem">on his part no firm resolve.&quot; <a class = "note" href = "notes.html#N213">213</a></p>
<p class="poem">Only the indwelling Word who is the covenant</p>
<p class="poem">can put his own eternal &quot;firm resolve&quot; in us,</p>
<p class="poem">for he is the promised indwelling law</p>
<p class="poem">to be written indelibly on the heart.<a class = "note" href = "notes.html#N214">214</a></p>
<p class="poem">As the prophet Malachi says,</p>
<p class="poem">the Messiah would be called,</p>
<p class="poem">&quot;The Messenger of the Covenant&quot; and the  &quot;Lord&quot;<a class = "note" href = "notes.html#N215">215</a></p>
<p class="poem">You have heard this saying:</p>
<p class="poem">&quot;When Jesus came</p>
<p class="poem">with clear signs, he said:</p>
<p class="poem">'...Fear <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   and obey me.&quot;'<a class = "note" href = "notes.html#N216">216</a></p>
<p class="poem">The &quot;clear signs&quot; Jesus came with</p>
<p class="poem">were the miracles he used to attest the eternal covenant</p>
<p class="poem">he would institute as the Lamb of God.</p>
<p class="poem">On that night, the night of the climax of his pilgrimage,</p>
<p class="poem">he took the bread and the cup</p>
<p class="poem">and he said that these were now the memorials</p>
<p class="poem">for remembrance of his body and his blood</p>
<p class="poem">of the New and Eternal Covenant of <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  .</p>
<p class="poem">&quot;Remember we took</p>
<p class="poem">a Covenant (mithaq) from the Children</p>
<p class="poem">of Israel...&quot; <a class = "note" href = "notes.html#N217">217</a></p>
<p class="poem">This covenant was celebrated each year</p>
<p class="poem">in the Passover meal,</p>
<p class="poem">where remembrance was made of how <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
</p>
<p class="poem">saved them at the Red Sea</p>
<p class="poem">and gave them the law on Mount Sinai.</p>
<p class="poem">It was at such a feast (id) of pilgrimage (hajj)</p>
<p class="poem">that Isa instituted a meal of remembrance</p>
<p class="poem">in which he would be the Lamb of God,</p>
<p class="poem">and his blood would effect a new exodus from sin,</p>
<p class="poem">a new hijrah (emigration) from sin and death</p>
<p class="poem">for all true new creation submitters to <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  .</p>
<p class="poem">Those who deny this truth have these two sayings</p>
<p class="poem">of their own to refute them:</p>
<p class="poem">&quot;Isa al-Masih (Jesus the Messiah)</p>
<p class="poem">was the Messenger of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   and his Word.&quot;<a class = "note" href = "notes.html#N218">218</a></p>
<p class="poem">&quot;And they (the children of Israel) said:</p>
<p class="poem">'<span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   took our promise not to believe</p>
<p class="poem">in a Messenger unless He showed us a  sacrifice&quot;'<a class = "note" href = "notes.html#N219">219</a></p>
                    <p class="poem">The common people did believe in great numbers</p>
<p class="poem">in the sacrifice that Isa showed them,</p>
<p class="poem">but the proud and self-comfortable religious leaders</p>
<p class="poem">did not believe and they led the people away from the  truth.</p>
<p class="poem">So it is today.</p>
<p class="poem">Isa himself said,</p>
<p class="poem">&quot;If the blind lead the blind,</p>
<p class="poem">both will fall into a pit.&quot;</p>
                    <p class="poem">But we who are Khalq Jadeed (New Creation) Muslims</p>
<p class="poem">do in fact submit to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
</p>
<p class="poem">by obeying him,</p>
<p class="poem">by embarking on a pilgrimage of witness</p>
<p class="poem">through the New Creation Wudu of <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
</p>
<p class="poem">to the New Creation Id ul-'Adha.</p>
<p class="poem">Just as Musa passed through death</p>
<p class="poem">at the Red Sea,</p>
<p class="poem">so we pass through the death of our old life</p>
<p class="poem">at the death ghusl of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  .</p>
<p class="poem">Just as the dead body of a Muslim</p>
<p class="poem">receives a total ablution (ghusl),</p>
<p class="poem">so by faith we put to death our body of sinful  disposition when</p>
<p class="poem">we take the ghusl of sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   (immersion).</p>
<p class="poem">Just as those with Musa</p>
<p class="poem">ate a sacrificial meal</p>
<p class="poem">to remember their sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   at the Red Sea,</p>
<p class="poem">so we who are messianic Muslims</p>
<p class="poem">eat a sacrificial meal</p>
<p class="poem">to remember our sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   at the command of Isa al-Masih.</p>
<p class="poem">You must know that a ghusl (total ablution)</p>
<p class="poem">was necessary for a dead body being buried,</p>
<p class="poem">and that it was also in order</p>
<p class="poem">before the 'Id prayers.</p>
                    <p class="poem">As with Moses and the Passover Seder Table,</p>
<p class="poem">so with Isa and the Lord's Table</p>
<p class="poem">--no one could be admitted to the Table</p>
<p class="poem">where the covenant was remembered</p>
<p class="poem">unless the covenant had been properly initiated.</p>
<p class="poem">Isa commanded that the sign of covenant initiation</p>
<p class="poem">be the death ghusl of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  ,</p>
<p class="poem">the wudu of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  .</p>
                    <p class="poem">Do you understand that you should</p>
<p class="poem">submit to sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   before taking</p>
<p class="poem">the New Creation Id ul-'Adha</p>
<p class="poem">with the other believers?</p>
                    <p class="poem">This water probe is designed by God</p>
<p class="poem">to be an overt sign of your submission to his authority.</p>
<p class="poem">God has commanded us in his infallibly accurate Word</p>

<p class="poem">God has also commanded us to confess him</p>
<p class="poem">in the sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   and the 'Id ul-Adha of Isa.</p>
<p class="poem">Now the question is,</p>
<p class="poem">will you submit to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   and truly obey Isa from your heart?</p>
<p class="poem">An immersion was before the Passover supper</p>
<p class="poem">and before the Last Supper of Isa</p>
<p class="poem">when he finished his pilgrimage</p>
<p class="poem">and offered himself as the eternal 'Id ul-Adha,</p>
<p class="poem">the Feast of Sacrifice,</p>
<p class="poem">the Lamb of God,</p>
<p class="poem">the bread of life that comes down from heaven.</p>
<p class="poem">Isa spoke of spiritually ingesting</p>
<p class="poem">the everlasting benefits of his sacrifice in this way:</p>
<p class="poem">&quot;Whoso eateth my flesh,</p>
<p class="poem">and drinketh my blood,</p>
<p class="poem">hath eternal life;</p>
<p class="poem">and I will raise him up on the last day.&quot;<a class = "note" href = "notes.html#N220">220</a></p>
<p class="poem">We also remember that Isa said of himself,</p>
<p class="poem">Even the Messiah &quot;came not to be served,</p>
<p class="poem">but to serve,</p>
<p class="poem">and to give his life as a ransom for many.&quot;<a class = "note" href = "notes.html#N221">221</a></p>
<p class="poem">In the Dead Sea Scrolls the prophet (Isaiah)</p>
<p class="poem">said the Messiah would &quot;bear the sin of many.&quot;</p>
<p class="poem">Isa was fulfilling that prophecy</p>
<p class="poem">made 700 years before,</p>
<p class="poem">and the dhabh (sacrifice) fulfillment</p>
<p class="poem">showed Isa's self-awareness</p>
<p class="poem">of his whole life's purpose.</p>
                    <p class="poem">We who are Khalq Jadeed (New Creation) Muslims</p>
<p class="poem">do not have to make a sacrifice</p>
<p class="poem">in the Valley of Mina in the vicinity of Mecca,</p>
<p class="poem">because the object of our pilgrimage <a class = "note" href = "notes.html#N222">222</a></p>
<p class="poem">has already made the perfect sacrifice for us.</p>
                    <p class="poem">Pilgrims are eager in Mecca to touch or kiss the Black  Stone as</p>
<p class="poem">if it represents the right hand of God,</p>
<p class="poem">with whom they are renewing their covenant.</p>
<p class="poem">But we who are Khalq Jadeed Muslims believe this verse:</p>
<p class="poem">&quot;Kiss the Son <a class = "note" href = "notes.html#N223">223</a></p>
<p class="poem">lest he be angry</p>
<p class="poem">and ye perish from the way.&quot;<a class = "note" href = "notes.html#N224">224</a></p>

<p class="poem">for He is the right hand of God's righteousness <a class = "note" href = "notes.html#N227">227</a></p>
<p class="poem">and in him alone is the covenant renewed.<a class = "note" href = "notes.html#N228">228</a></p>
<p class="poem">When we stand up at the New Creation Id ul-Adha</p>
<p class="poem">it is not because the pilgrims stand</p>
<p class="poem">to perform the wuquf (the &quot;standing&quot;)</p>
<p class="poem">from noon until sunset at 'Arafat.</p>
<p class="poem">We stand because whoever eats this bread and drinks this  cup</p>
<p class="poem">preaches the death of the Lord until he comes.<a class = "note" href = "notes.html#N229">229</a></p>
<p class="poem">Therefore, we confess Isa in prayer,</p>
<p class="poem">we confess him before true believers,</p>
<p class="poem">we confess him in the sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  ,</p>
<p class="poem">and we confess him in the Id ul-Adha.</p>
<p class="poem">The Scripture says,</p>
<p class="poem">&quot;If you confess with your lips the Lord Isa (Jesus)</p>
<p class="poem">and believe in your heart that God raised him from the  dead</p>
<p class="poem">(he died for our sins and was buried</p>
<p class="poem">and rose again on the third day</p>
<p class="poem">according to the Scriptures),</p>
<p class="poem">you shall be saved.&quot;<a class = "note" href = "notes.html#N230">230</a></p>
<p class="poem">When those pilgrims stand under the scorching sun</p>
<p class="poem">on the ninth day of the final hajj month,</p>
<p class="poem">they pray and recite verses of the Qur'an,</p>
<p class="poem">hoping that their sins will be forgiven.</p>
<p class="poem">But we know our sins</p>
<p class="poem">are already forgiven in Isa's name,</p>
<p class="poem">in the name of Jesus,</p>
<p class="poem">and a day is coming when all those who reject Isa</p>
<p class="poem">will stand before the scorching heat of the Word of God.</p>
<p class="poem">When we take Isa's cup,</p>
<p class="poem">then we also remember that Isa said,</p>
<p class="poem">&quot;Whoever is thirsty,</p>
<p class="poem">let him come to me and drink.</p>
<p class="poem">.....whoever drinks of the water</p>
<p class="poem">that I shall give him</p>
<p class="poem">shall never thirst;</p>

<p class="poem">The Kaaba has a door,</p>

<p class="poem">New creation Muslims are still Muslims (submitters to  God).<a class = "note" href = "notes.html#N239">239</a>.</p>

<p class="poem">on their identity card,</p>
<p class="poem">expecting people to alienate themselves from</p>

                    <p class="poem">The Sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   is not the cleansing of the body,</p>

<p class="poem">or cleanse sin (I Peter 3:21).</p>
                    <p class="poem">This is a humanly contrived teaching which ignorant men</p>
<p class="poem">have tried to add to God's Word.</p>
<p class="poem">In this misunderstanding, Muslim religionists can be as  guilty as</p>
<p class="poem">Christian religionists.</p>
<p class="poem">For example, nowhere does the Qur'an teach that the wudu</p>
<p class="poem">(washing prior to the five-times-daily prayers)</p>
<p class="poem">cleanses from sin.</p>
<p class="poem">Some believe that when a believer</p>
<p class="poem">washes his face, hands and feet,</p>
<p class="poem">every sin connected with these parts of the body</p>
<p class="poem">will come out as a result of ablution.</p>
<p class="poem">But we know that only the infinitely precious blood</p>
<p class="poem">of the Masih's sacrifice</p>
<p class="poem">can wash away sins,</p>
<p class="poem">and our faith is in his blood alone.</p>
<p class="poem">The fallacy of believing in the cleansing power of mere  water is</p>
<p class="poem">obvious enough:</p>
<p class="poem">if we really believe the water cleanses and makes holy,</p>
<p class="poem">why do we not use water to make swine's flesh</p>
<p class="poem">ritually pure and usable?</p>
<p class="poem">Those who have concocted these sorts of beliefs</p>
<p class="poem">are trapped by their own fallacies.</p>
<p class="poem">However, we recommend that new believers walk softly</p>

                    <p class="poem">It is important to remember</p>
<p class="poem">that according to the Bible, an ordinance</p>
<p class="poem">is a symbolic rite instituted by Isa al-Masih.</p>
<p class="poem">There are two: immersion in the proper name of God</p>
<p class="poem">and a communion meal in remembrance of Isa.</p>

<p class="poem">and the other renews it.</p>
<p class="poem">Of the two ordinances,</p>
<p class="poem">the first communion meal was celebrated in secrecy.</p>
<p class="poem">Why? Because of enemies and spies,</p>
<p class="poem">one of whom (Judas) managed to intrude into the rite,</p>

<p class="poem">Therefore, whoever says that an ordinance</p>
<p class="poem">can not be secret and private in times of danger</p>
<p class="poem">does not know much about the New Testament.</p>
                    <p class="poem">At the time of danger after the persecution</p>
<p class="poem">following the martyrdom of Stephen,</p>
<p class="poem">who witnessed the sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   of the Ethiopian eunuch</p>
<p class="poem">but Philip who administered the ordinance as its only  witness?</p>
<p class="poem">Martyrdom is not to be encouraged.</p>
<p class="poem">Isa instructed his disciples to be wise as serpents</p>
<p class="poem">but as harmless as doves</p>
<p class="poem">and not to cast pearls before dangerous people</p>
<p class="poem">who would turn and try to tear them</p>
<p class="poem">with such precious personal information. <a class = "note" href = "notes.html#N250">250</a></p>
<p class="poem">My ethical problem is whether I will obey the Lord</p>
<p class="poem">and take sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  .</p>
<p class="poem">The ritual itself need not even be discussed with someone</p>
<p class="poem">who translates it as an &quot;act of a traitor.&quot;</p>
<p class="poem">The holy things of the Lord are not for outsiders.</p>
<p class="poem">Such a person needs to understand and yield to salvation</p>
<p class="poem">before he is ready to hear about sibghat <span  lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  ,</p>
<p class="poem">which comes after and not before salvation.</p>
                    <p class="poem">Jesus cast no pearls before Pilate, Herod, or Caiaphas,</p>
<p class="poem">and these swine were amazed at his silence.</p>
<p class="poem">But he knew what was in a man,</p>
<p class="poem">whether his heart was open or whether he was dangerous,</p>
<p class="poem">and he needed no one to tell him what was in a person.</p>
<p class="poem">So it is with our sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>

<p class="poem">We who are the leaders in the messianic Muslim movement</p>

<p class="poem">Whether he or she is the only candidate at the ceremony</p>

<p class="poem">They may or may not have witnesses.</p>
<p class="poem">The Imam himself is sufficient witness.</p>
<p class="poem">Certainly no one should be there who may turn out to be</p>
<p class="poem">a Judas and inform the religious authorities.</p>
<p class="poem">The ceremony may at times of danger be as private</p>
<p class="poem">as the Lord's Supper was at a similar time,</p>
<p class="poem">for on that night Isa al-Masih</p>
<p class="poem">was hidden from the eyes of all wicked men</p>
<p class="poem">with his small flock of a dozen disciples.</p>
<p class="poem">No one who could hurt them was allowed to know</p>
<p class="poem">where the ceremony took place or who the participants  were.</p>
<p class="poem">It took an inside informer, Judas,</p>
<p class="poem">to make the whereabouts of the ceremony</p>
<p class="poem">a matter of information for the enemies of Isa.</p>
                    <p class="poem">The men who were with Isa</p>
<p class="poem">appreciated his efforts to protect them.</p>
<p class="poem">However, one of these disciples (hawari), John,</p>
<p class="poem">wrote later in Revelation 21:8</p>
<p class="poem">that cowards will find themselves in the lake of fire.</p>
<p class="poem">The main reason Judas left the secret ceremony</p>
<p class="poem">and would not involve himself in it any further,</p>
<p class="poem">was because he was a coward</p>
<p class="poem">who feared that Jesus (and he) would be killed.</p>
<p class="poem">Therefore, he tried to save his life</p>
<p class="poem">by betraying Isa to the authorities.</p>

<p class="poem">will save it and keep it for eternity.&quot; (Mark 8:35)</p>
                    <p class="poem">Therefore, the Muslim candidate (mutarabbis)</p>
<p class="poem">or candidates have thoroughly counted the cost</p>

<p class="poem">Now, everyone should know that when a Muslim is buried</p>
<p class="poem">his body is given a special burial washing.</p>
<p class="poem">This is called a ghusl.</p>
<p class="poem">In the ghusl every impurity is to be removed from the  body</p>

<p class="poem">A dead man can no longer sin.</p>

<p class="poem">However, when he walked out into the water</p>
<p class="poem">at the river Jordan</p>
<p class="poem">it was as though the Judge of all men</p>
<p class="poem">was putting on a prisoner's uniform,</p>
<p class="poem">and beginning the process of becoming</p>
<p class="poem">the vicarious substitute who would</p>
<p class="poem">take the place of this condemned-to-hell human race.</p>
<p class="poem">He is the Wahid <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>

<p class="poem">because he lacks a human father.</p>
<p class="poem">He alone lacks the nature of our sin-prone fathers,</p>
<p class="poem">because he alone of all men is the very Word of God.</p>
<p class="poem">Other prophets heard the Word of God</p>
<p class="poem">but he alone is the Word of God,</p>
<p class="poem">and as the Word of God</p>
<p class="poem">he is the Word of Judgment.</p>
<p class="poem">Therefore, God in his great justice (qist)</p>
<p class="poem">sent the Word of his Judgment himself</p>
<p class="poem">to be our substitute</p>
<p class="poem">and to mercifully stand in for us (badil).</p>
<p class="poem">Therefore <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>

<p class="poem">the merciful Word of our judgment took our place.</p>
<p class="poem">He, who was innocent and pure and unworthy of judgment,</p>
<p class="poem">took the whole weight of our condemnation on himself.</p>
<p class="poem">He was arrested in our place,</p>
<p class="poem">he was put on trial in our place,</p>

                    <p class="poem">This is what Isa meant when he spoke to</p>
<p class="poem">John the Baptist (Yahya) that day.</p>
<p class="poem">John was calling the sons of Ibrahim</p>

<p class="poem">of being unclean before <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">

<p class="poem">He preached a ghusl (total ritual ablution of the body)  of</p>

<p class="poem">The self-righteous person,</p>

<p class="poem">The ultra-religious of his day,</p>
<p class="poem">the mullahs of the sect of the Pharisees,</p>
<p class="poem">would not submit to his ghusl.</p>
<p class="poem">They considered themselves secure</p>
<p class="poem">in their religious gnosis (knowledge)</p>
<p class="poem">and in the praise they got from men</p>
<p class="poem">for their religious good deeds,</p>
<p class="poem">and they were not seeking the praise</p>
<p class="poem">that comes from God alone.</p>
<p class="poem">Yahya warned the whole religious establishment of his day</p>
<p class="poem">that all such hypocritical religious snakes</p>
<p class="poem">would be thrown by the Messiah the Judge (Masih al-Hakam)</p>
<p class="poem">into the eternal fire.</p>
<p class="poem">When John saw Isa coming</p>
<p class="poem">to take the sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   from him,</p>
<p class="poem">he said that he (John) should rather be immersed by Isa,</p>
<p class="poem">John knew that even though he was a prophet, he was still</p>
<p class="poem">very much a sinner by nature,<a class = "note" href = "notes.html#N253">253</a></p>
<p class="poem">as is every sin-prone child of his sin-prone parents.</p>
<p class="poem">But Isa was the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   himself</p>
<p class="poem">and there is no sin in the Word of <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  .</p>
<p class="poem">However, Isa answered John this way:</p>
<p class="poem">&quot;Allow it to be so now:</p>
<p class="poem">for thus it becometh us</p>
<p class="poem">to fulfill all righteousness.&quot;</p>
<p class="poem">Isa meant that sinners could be accounted righteous,</p>
<p class="poem">and righteousness could be made complete</p>
<p class="poem">only if the righteous Word of<span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
<p class="poem">personally suffered a death for the wicked.</p>
<p class="poem">Only then could the wicked enter into that death,</p>
<p class="poem">and, repenting, die to wickedness,</p>
<p class="poem">and come alive to true, holy life</p>
<p class="poem">through the spiritual new birth.</p>
<p class="poem">Only the righteous Word of our judgment</p>
<p class="poem">could become this substitute, this replacement ('iwadan).</p>
<p class="poem">He was the only one who is the Word of God</p>
<p class="poem">and therefore he was qualified to make compensation for  us.</p>
<p class="poem">He paid with his death the price</p>
<p class="poem">for our sins ('ada'u).</p>
<p class="poem">He gave a just and merciful exchange:</p>
<p class="poem">his sinless life given in death,</p>
<p class="poem">a death which he did not deserve,</p>
<p class="poem">was exchanged for our death-deserving sin;</p>
<p class="poem">and the gift was given to us of eternal life</p>
<p class="poem">which we do not deserve.</p>
                    <p class="poem">All of this was so clear to Isa at the time</p>
<p class="poem">of his sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  .</p>
<p class="poem">And later he explained to his disciples (hawari),</p>
<p class="poem">in a cryptic prophetic allusion to his death in al-Quds:</p>
<p class="poem">&quot;But I have a baptism (referring to a total  immersion</p>
<p class="poem">into suffering that was coming to him shortly)</p>

<p class="poem">and how I am straitened (distressed)</p>
<p class="poem">till it be accomplished!&quot;(Luke 12:50)</p>
<p class="poem">Imagine an imam and a Khalq Jadeed Muslim</p>
<p class="poem">approaching the water in a secluded place</p>
<p class="poem">such as where the Lord's Supper was celebrated.</p>
<p class="poem">Imagine the joy of the occasion</p>
<p class="poem">but also the seriousness,</p>
<p class="poem">because we cannot</p>
<p class="poem">enter into the new creation life of the Word of God</p>
<p class="poem">unless we enter into his death.</p>
<p class="poem">Imagine that the imam and the new creation Muslims</p>
<p class="poem">are wearing white</p>
<p class="poem">and that the white they are wearing represents</p>

<p class="poem">The Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">

<p class="poem">So how can we begin the pilgrimage,</p>
<p class="poem">if we have not obeyed even the first commandment?</p>
<p class="poem">You have heard the saying:</p>

<p class="poem">to cover their shame.<a class = "note" href = "notes.html#N255">255</a></p>

<p class="poem">that the guilty not go unpunished<a class = "note" href = "notes.html#N256">256</a></p>
<p class="poem">and since his mercy</p>
<p class="poem">has given us a means of covering our shame,</p>
<p class="poem">we who are Khalq Jadeed (New Creation) Muslims</p>
<p class="poem">put on Isa himself as our raiment of righteousness</p>
<p class="poem">when we rise out of the water</p>
<p class="poem">to begin our pilgrimage,</p>
<p class="poem">a journey on which we are being transformed</p>
<p class="poem">into his likeness</p>
<p class="poem">with ever-increasing glory</p>
<p class="poem">which comes from the Lord,</p>
<p class="poem">who is the Spirit. <a class = "note" href = "notes.html#N257">257</a></p>
                    <p class="poem">It says in the Qur'an</p>
<p class="poem">that &quot;the pagans are unclean&quot;<a class = "note" href = "notes.html#N258">258</a></p>
<p class="poem">but it takes more than religion or water ablutions</p>
<p class="poem">to make one truly Muslim.</p>
<p class="poem">For many who say they are Muslim</p>
<p class="poem">are pagans at heart,</p>
<p class="poem">and appear clean on the outside of the cup</p>
<p class="poem">but inside are filled with every kind of hypocrisy.</p>
<p class="poem">Only the inner tahara of the new birth</p>
<p class="poem">can remove the inner pagan uncleanness</p>
<p class="poem">and make one a spiritual submitter (Muslim) within.</p>
<p class="poem">Isa says that wherever two or more are</p>
<p class="poem">gathered in his name,</p>
<p class="poem">there He is in the midst of them</p>
<p class="poem">for koinonia or spiritual converse.</p>
<p class="poem">The word for this, most Muslims hear all the time</p>
<p class="poem">but do not understand it.</p>
<p class="poem">Near Mount Sinai, Moses drew near to God</p>
<p class="poem">for spiritual converse (najiy). <a class = "note" href = "notes.html#N259">259</a></p>
<p class="poem">Unfortunately, this is a word that is not widely  understood.</p>
<p class="poem">It carries the idea</p>
<p class="poem">of communication or connection (ittisaal).</p>
<p class="poem">When we have spiritual converse or koinonia,</p>
<p class="poem">we have ittisaal.</p>
<p class="poem">We are in connection for communication with <span  lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">

<p class="poem">At the upper room during the Last Supper</p>
<p class="poem">Judas ate bread with the rest,</p>

</p>
<p class="poem">or in the bread of the New Creation Id ul-Adha.</p>
<p class="poem">The power is in the ittisaal, in the najiy,</p>

<p class="poem">in the connection, in the communication with <span  lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  .</p>
<p class="poem">There is another meaning in this word.</p>
<p class="poem">It has to do with fellowship or comradeship (zamala).</p>
<p class="poem">Believers experience the zamala in the comradeship</p>
<p class="poem">of being partakers and partners in the grace</p>
<p class="poem">of the Good News.</p>
<p class="poem">It is a comradeship in the Spirit.</p>
<p class="poem">Now, men in an army</p>
<p class="poem">know what esprit de corps ('asabiya) is,</p>
<p class="poem">and in any organization or group,</p>
<p class="poem">religious or otherwise,</p>
<p class="poem">such a feeling of team spirit is not unheard of.</p>
<p class="poem">However, zamala (comradeship) in the Eternal Spirit</p>
<p class="poem">is a comradeship with the Word of God himself.</p>
<p class="poem">It means experiencing his sufferings and his joys</p>
<p class="poem">and his vision and his victories with him.</p>
<p class="poem">Judas experienced the bread of the Lord's feast (id)</p>

                    <p class="poem">Here we are talking about a spiritual knowledge.</p>
<p class="poem">Koinonia is not fiqh, the exercise of the intelligence</p>
<p class="poem">or the legal mind.</p>
<p class="poem">It is not 'arif, that so-called knowledge</p>
<p class="poem">of the mystical knower</p>
<p class="poem">who thinks he apprehends God</p>
<p class="poem">by immediate experience and vision</p>
<p class="poem">but without the new birth of regeneration through Isa.</p>
<p class="poem">Koinonia is the knowledge ('ilm) of regeneration (nahda)</p>

<p class="poem">Here is the testimony of Ahmad,</p>
<p class="poem">whom God gave the grace not to be cowardly.</p>
<p class="poem">This is a true testimony</p>
<p class="poem">in his own words.</p>
	<h2 class="subtitle">AHMAD TELLS HIS OWN STORY</h2>
	<p class="text">I had been raised as a Muslim in a very Muslim house for 
	 the first eighteen years that I was at home. Later, as an 
	 adult, I started hearing about Jesus. According to the Qur'an I 
	 had believed that Jesus was one of God's prophets.</p>
	<p class="text">As time went on, I started hearing more and more about him, how 
	 he died for the human race to set men free from sin, sickness and 
	 every bondage. Prior to hearing all this, I had always wondered 
	 about sickness and disease and why God would take so many people 
	 at a very young age or put sickness on them. If mankind is God's 
	 masterpiece, I always wondered what kind of Creator would create 
	 a masterpiece and then watch his masterpiece deteriorate without 
	 doing something about it.</p>
	<p class="text">I kept saying to myself, &quot;God, I love you and I have been 
	 brought up to worship you, but I don't know anything about Isa 
	 (Jesus).&quot; This went on for about three years. 
	 In January, 1982, 1 had started my own business. Two months 
	 later, my wife and I made an agreement to sit down and read the 
	 Bible and find out first hand who Isa is and what he has done for 
	 the human race. As we read the Bible, I was amazed to see that it 
	 is just as true as I had been told. We continued to read the 
	 Bible for several weeks and at the same time we were listening to 
	 teaching tapes about the Bible.</p>
	<p class="text">I read the Word of God in John 3:3, &quot;Truly, truly, I say to you, 
	 unless one is born again he cannot see the Kingdom of God.&quot; Isa 
	 was simply saying that we are born of flesh and blood. However, 
	 unless we are born of the Spirit and come to know 
	 God personally, we can not see the Kingdom of God.</p>
	<p class="text">My wife and I were stirred by Romans 10 where it says&quot;if you 
	 confess with your mouth Isa as Lord and believe in your heart 
	 that God raised him from the dead, you shall be saved.&quot; Right at 
	 that point my wife and I knew that in our hearts a change was 
	 taking place. Until then I did not know of any way to change our 
	 sinful nature and to be acceptable to God without trying to earn 
	 a right standing by being religious. I knew that God was speaking 
	 to us, but I was confused.</p>
	<p class="text">Then it was as if God was speaking to my heart and saying, &quot;You 
	 are not denying anything, you are believing in the Name of my 
	 Word, Isa al-Masih, whom I have sent into the world so that the 
	 world may be set free from sin. I have done this because I love 
	 the people, mankind, whom I have created.&quot;</p>
	<p class="text">It was then that my wife and I made up our minds to believe. And 
	 right at that time, I could feel the joy of the Lord grasping&nbsp; my 
	 whole body as I realized that Isa had gone down to the pit to pay 
	 for our sins there and to carry away our sicknesses and diseases. 
	 Then we started reading the Bible regularly, listening to 
	 teaching tapes and not only reading and hearing the Word of God, 
	 but also making the decision to do the Word of God the way God 
	 said it and to live in it so that we could receive from God in 
	 the manner he had intended for us to receive from him. 
	 Then so many good things started happening to us. My wife got 
	 healed from kidney problems, from swelling and from foot problems 
	 after we prayed in the Name of Isa and believed that God's 
	 healing was for us.</p>
	<p class="text">As we continued to read the Bible we actually came closer and 
	 closer to God. We learned how to overcome problems by finding the 
	 answer and the promise and claiming it in his Word. Consequently, 
	 both our bodies and business have been blessed by the Lord. Not 
	 only that, but God has purified us by the study of his Word, so 
	 that instead of arguments and selfishness there has been peace 
	 and love in our home.</p>
	<p class="text">The Bible says that God has made Isa al-Masih our redemption, 
	 sanctification, righteousness, and wisdom. When you know that he 
	 is all this for us, you not only have the peace of the assurance 
	 of your salvation, you also can overcome all things that come 
	 against you.</p>
	<p class="text">For example, my Muslim friend, Mehmet, had just had brain surgery 
	 not long ago to remove a cancerous tumor. He was dying. He was 
	 sad. He was fearful. He didn't want to die, and he didn't think 
	 that God really wanted to take him at the age of 32. When I first 
	 ran into him, he told me that he was dying and he was so sad. I 
	 looked at him and I told him &quot;Jesus can heal you.&quot; His response 
	 was &quot;Who is that?&quot;</p>
	<p class="text">After a while we got together, and I started sharing with 
	 him from the Word of God. I told him that Jesus had died for him, 
	 that Isa was sent to this world for his sake to set him free, 
	 that God was calling all people to Him through his Word Isa, and 
	 that when we believe in his Name, we can be helped through every 
	 trial that befalls us.</p>
	<p class="text">Mehmet could not make the commitment right away. He was raised in 
	 a Muslim home and it took a while for the word of God to sink in. 
	 But as we shared, Mehmet started feeling inside of him that the 
	 Scriptures I showed him were the Word of God. He believed that 
	 somehow the truth could set him free. He finally said that he 
	 wanted to receive Isa as his Saviour so that Isa the Word of 
	 <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  would reign supreme in his heart. He did. 
	 Several weeks later, when doctors examined him, he was completely 
	 healed.<a class = "note" href = "notes.html#N261">261</a></p>
	<p class="text">Miraculously healed with no evidence of cancer being left behind! 
	 Now Mehmet had the joy; his face was shining with joy and with 
	 glory and with the happiness that comes from knowing the Lord. 
	 When I ran into him again, all he could talk about was how good 
	 God is, how good his Word Isa is, and how he had been set free by 
	 believing in the Name of Jesus.</p>
	<p class="text">I recently submitted to God by obeying him regarding the sibghat 
	 <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  and was immersed as He commands. This simple act signifies 
	 that my old life without him was buried in the water and my new 
	 life (and he is the source of that life) has been raised again 
	 with him as he made me a new person, a new creation, a Khalq 
	 Jadeed Muslim. Since I have obeyed the Lord in this, in taking 
	 the sibghat <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> , I have felt closer to God and closer to His 
	 Word. The sibghat <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  (baptism of God) is a simple remembrance 
	 of the death and resurrection of Isa al-Masih. Every time I 
	 remember that day and that simple act, I remember that I am set 
	 free from all the bondages and all the shortcomings of this world 
	 through the overcoming power I have in Isa al-Masih. 
	 My prayer is that other Muslims like Mehmet and I will 
	 inquire of the Word of God and receive Isa as the Word 
	 of God so that they too will receive the priceless joy and the 
	power that overcomes the world. Amen.</p>
