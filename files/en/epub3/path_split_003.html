<h2 class="subtitle" id="calibre_pb_2">HOW GOD HAD BEEN PREPARING TO ANSWER PRAYER</h2>
	<p class="poem">Here is the true story:</p>
	<p class="poem">A young man and his wife</p>
	<p class="poem">had been travelling for several days</p>
	<p class="poem">looking for the man of God.</p>
	<p class="poem"><span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  had led them on a spiritual pilgrimage,</p>
	<p class="poem">for <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  foreknew both the prayer and its answer,</p>
	<p class="poem">which He was now effecting.</p>
	<p class="poem">We will call these two muridun (aspirants)</p>
	<p class="poem">Isha and Ahmad.</p>
	<p class="poem">They had long heard of the spiritual 'ilm (knowledge)</p>
	<p class="poem">of the man of God,</p>
	<p class="poem">though they had never met him personally.</p>
	<p class="poem">And so they went out like Ibrahim (Abraham),</p>
	<p class="poem">"who by faith obeyed</p>
	<p class="poem">when he was called to go out to a place</p>
	<p class="poem">which he was to receive as an inheritance;</p>
	<p class="poem">and he went out,</p>
	<p class="poem">not knowing where he was to go."</p>
	<p class="poem">Like Ibrahim, the man and wife wanted to seek</p>
	<p class="poem">the straight path,</p>
	<p class="poem">the path of the just,</p>
	<p class="poem">and they sought to do this under the huda (guidance)</p>
	<p class="poem">of the man of God.</p>
	<p class="poem">The man and woman wanted to submit their lives to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">and find the path of life in His Word,</p>
	<p class="poem">as it says,</p>
	<p class="poem">"Make me to go in the path of thy commandments,</p>
	<p class="poem">for therein do I delight."</p>
	<p class="poem">However, Isha and Ahmad did not know in which village</p>
	<p class="poem">the man of God lived,</p>
	<p class="poem">nor the street location of his dwelling.</p>
	<p class="poem">But praise be to God</p>
	<p class="poem">for it says,</p>
	<p class="poem">"Thy word is a lamp unto my feet</p>
	<p class="poem">and a light unto my path."</p>
