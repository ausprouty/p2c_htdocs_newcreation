	<p class="poem">"Our Lord! forgive us</p>
	<p class="poem">our sins and anything</p>
	<p class="poem">we may have done</p>
	<p class="poem">that transgressed our duty:</p>
	<p class="poem">establish our feet firmly,</p>

	<p class="poem">"Not by works of righteousness</p>
	<p class="poem">which we have done,</p>

	<p class="poem">he saved us,</p>

	<p class="poem">Water is the outward and visible sign,</p>
	<p class="poem">and the regeneration of the new birth</p>
	<p class="poem">is the inward and spiritual grace</p>
	<p class="poem">of the sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> ,</p>
	<p class="poem">which signifies the remission of sins.<a class="note" href="notes.html#N274">274</a></p>
	<p class="poem">We who are sons of Ibrahim by faith</p>
	<p class="poem">gather together at this place of water</p>
	<p class="poem">to submit ourselves to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  according to his Word,</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa al-Masih.</p>
	<p class="poem">The white we wear symbolizes our pilgrim status</p>
	<p class="poem">as we begin a life of obedience</p>
	<p class="poem">unto the tariqa (way) of holiness,</p>
	<p class="poem">which is a life we share together in Him.</p>
	<p class="poem">We confess that mere water</p>
	<p class="poem">cannot give us the status of tahara (undefilement),</p>
	<p class="poem">since only the Eternal Spirit can circumcise away</p>
	<p class="poem">our Spiritual uncleanness and can cut away</p>
	<p class="poem">the pull of our lower nature</p>
	<p class="poem">and the lusts that pull us down.</p>
	<p class="poem">Yet <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  has promised to provide this spiritual tahara</p>
	<p class="poem">if we will obey his Word Isa al-Masih.</p>
	<p class="poem">with an undivided heart.</p>
	<p class="poem">The Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> , Isa al-Masih,</p>
	<p class="poem">commands us to be immersed and buried with him.</p>
	<p class="poem">This is our acceptable preparation for 'ibadat (worship).</p>
	<p class="poem">To the candidate (mutarabbis):</p>
	<p class="poem">      Do you confess that you are a sinner,</p>
	<p class="poem">      and that Isa al-Masih is the only way</p>
	<p class="poem">      your sins can be forgiven</p>
	<p class="poem">      and that you can know</p>
	<p class="poem">      you have forgiveness and eternal life in God?</p>
	<p class="poem">Candidate: I do.</p>
	<p class="poem">(This is the time when a personal testimony would be appropriate.</p>
	<p class="poem">"And I say unto you, whosoever shall confess me before men, him</p>
	<p class="poem">shall the Son of Man also confess before the angels of God: But</p>
	<p class="poem">he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels</p>
	<p class="poem">of God."-Luke 12:8,9; Mt.1O:32. "If thou shalt confess the Lord</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa (Jesus) and shalt believe in thine heart that God has raised</p>
	<p class="poem">him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man</p>
	<p class="poem">believeth unto righteousness: and with the mouth confession is</p>
	<p class="poem">made unto salvation."--Romans 10:9,10. "For we ourselves also</p>
	<p class="poem">were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving all kinds</p>
	<p class="poem">of passions and pleasures, living in malice and envy,hateful,</p>
	<p class="poem">and hating one another. But after that the kindness and love of</p>
	<p class="poem">God our Savior toward man appeared. Not by works of</p>
	<p class="poem">righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he</p>
	<p class="poem">saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the</p>
	<p class="poem">Holy Spirit, which he shed on us abundantly through Isa al-Masih</p>
	<p class="poem">our Savior; that being justified by his grace, we should  be made</p>
	<p class="poem">heirs according to the hope of eternal life."--Titus3:3-7.)</p>
	<p class="poem">To the candidate:</p>
	<p class="poem">Repeat after me,</p>
	<p class="poem">Lord, I confess all my sins before you right now.</p>
	<p class="poem">And I thank you that Isa al-Masih paid for them all</p>
	<p class="poem">by his precious blood so that I can become clean</p>
	<p class="poem">and join the family of the redeemed as a child of God</p>
	<p class="poem">who is my loving heavenly Father.</p>
	<p class="poem">I repent and renounce all my sins</p>
	<p class="poem">and I promise before this witness that by His strength</p>
	<p class="poem">I will never turn back to my sins</p>
	<p class="poem">or intentionally grieve the Eternal Holy Spirit.</p>
	<p class="poem">I believe that there is one God</p>
	<p class="poem">Who infallibly revealed himself</p>
	<p class="poem">with the personal distinctions</p>
	<p class="poem">of God</p>
	<p class="poem">and His Word</p>
	<p class="poem">and His Spirit</p>
	<p class="poem">with the one name of Father and Filial Word and Eternal Spirit.</p>
	<p class="poem">I do not believe that God took a wife</p>
	<p class="poem">in order that Isa could become his son through Mary.</p>
	<p class="poem">I believe that his Eternal Word, incarnated as Isa,</p>
	<p class="poem">was always with God and was always God</p>
	<p class="poem">and therefore that the Eternal Word</p>
	<p class="poem">always knew God as Eternal Father.</p>
	<p class="poem">Today I am entering into a covenant</p>
	<p class="poem">which this water rite initiates through faith,</p>
	<p class="poem">and I am promising God in this solemn ceremony</p>
	<p class="poem">that I will be a faithful part of his family forever,</p>
	<p class="poem">not forsaking the assembling of those</p>
	<p class="poem">who are khalq jadeed (new creation) submitters to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> .</p>
	<p class="poem">When I pass through this water rite,</p>
	<p class="poem">I will be formally welcomed as a member</p>
	<p class="poem">of the khalq jadeed ummah (community)</p>
	<p class="poem">of true believers in the Wahid <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> ,</p>
	<p class="poem">the Unique One of God, Isa al-Masih.</p>
	<p class="poem">To the candidate:</p>
	<p class="poem">Do you solemnly promise that you will remember</p>
	<p class="poem">and renew this covenant initiated in water</p>
	<p class="poem">by assembling for the celebration of the messianic Idul-Adha</p>
	<p class="poem">with your brothers and sisters in the faith,</p>
	<p class="poem">and that you will zealously study the faith</p>
	<p class="poem">once for all inerrantly recorded in the Scriptures</p>
	<p class="poem">and that you will pray that God will open a door</p>
	<p class="poem">for you to share your faith and serve Him in it?</p>
	<p class="poem">[In some cases the male candidates may want</p>
	<p class="poem">to wear the prayer hat called the targheer</p>
	<p class="poem">or the koofi or koofayah.</p>
	<p class="poem">The prayer robe is called the galibeers.</p>
	<p class="poem">This would symbolize that he is not changing</p>
	<p class="poem">religious labels and would point to</p>
	<p class="poem">the new creation. The point of the rite is</p>
	<p class="poem">not assimilation away from the familiar</p>
	<p class="poem">but newness of life within the familiar.]<a class="note" href="notes.html#N275">275</a></p>
