<h2 class="subtitle" id="calibre_pb_4">YEARS LATER ANOTHER MIRACLE HAPPENS</h2>
	<p class="poem">Would it take a miracle</p>
	<p class="poem">to show you the difference</p>
	<p class="poem">between a true Islamic teacher</p>
	<p class="poem">and a pseudo-Islamic teacher?</p>
	<p class="poem">Very recently Ahmad called the man of God</p>
	<p class="poem">long distance on the telephone to tell him</p>
	<p class="poem">that Isha wanted a divorce.</p>
	<p class="poem">They had been having marriage problems</p>
	<p class="poem">and she had turned to a man for help,</p>
	<p class="poem">a fraud who claimed to be a good murshid (spiritual guide) but</p>
	<p class="poem">who was in reality</p>
	<p class="poem">a pseudo-Islamic shaman</p>
	<p class="poem">trafficking in the realm of spells</p>
	<p class="poem">and charms and sorcery,</p>
	<p class="poem">witchcraft, talismans and familiar spirits,</p>
	<p class="poem">divining, saint worship, and demons,</p>
	<p class="poem">fortune-telling, incantations and the evil eye.</p>
	<p class="poem">It says somewhere,</p>
	<p class="poem">"Acquaint now thyself with Him (God)</p>
	<p class="poem">and be at peace;</p>
	<p class="poem">thereby good shall come unto Thee."</p>
	<p class="poem">But some people want to get more acquainted</p>
	<p class="poem">with jinn or demons rather than the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> ,</p>
	<p class="poem">as it says,</p>
	<p class="poem">"My people perish for lack of knowledge of Thy word,</p>
	<p class="poem">for they have rejected the knowledge of thy Word."</p>
	<p class="poem">The haram (forbidden) demon procurer</p>
	<p class="poem">whom Isha consulted</p>
	<p class="poem">promised her peace</p>
	<p class="poem">and even dramatic out-of-the-body psychic experiences;</p>
	<p class="poem">he claimed to offer her direct access</p>
	<p class="poem">to "Spiritual Masters" who make their appearance</p>
	<p class="poem">as "light-being entities."</p>
	<p class="poem">Such counterfeit guides, as this man, are like</p>
	<p class="poem">the devils with whom they commune.</p>
	<p class="poem">They are unclean religious peddlers</p>
	<p class="poem">disguised as servants of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> .</p>
	<p class="poem">There is nothing unexpected about such frauds</p>
	<p class="poem">if, as it says,</p>
	<p class="poem">"Shaitan himself goes disguised as an angel of light</p>
	<p class="poem">seeking whom he may devour."</p>
