</p><p id="N72" class="note1"><span class="note_number">72</span> Friday is an important "Day of Assembly"  for New Creation 
Muslims.  Like those early believers in the Injil or  the New 
Testament, we know that the homes of the faithful are  acceptable 
to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   as places of prayer--see Acts 2:42,46. Friday is 
important to us because on Friday Isa, performed the  great act 
that has become the foundation for the forgiveness of our  sins: 
on Friday nearly two thousand years ago Isa shed his  blood to 
cover and make expiation or kaffarah for our corrupt and  fallen 
human nature.  Since it is this noon prayer that is  used at the 
Friday services, the Zuhr prayer is given in this section  in its 
entirety.  "One person thinks that some days  are holier than 
others, and another thinks them all equal.  Let each  of them be 
fully convinced in his own mind." Romans 14:5 <a class="return" href="prayer_split_001.html#R72"> ( Return ) </a>

Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   performed the ceremonial washing in the upper 
room--see John 13:3-17. We approach our prayers as it  says in 
Hebrews 10:22 "with our bodies washed with pure  water" to remind 
us that we are clean before God only as we are submerged  into the 
death of Isa, submitting our bodies as Eternal  Spirit-washed and 
dead-to-sin living sacrifices, trusting his death alone  to ransom 
us from the penalty of our old corrupt nature. <a class="return" href="prayer_split_001.html#R74"> ( Return ) </a>

</p><p id="N77" class="note1"><span class="note_number">77</span> We do not believe that the water protects us from  demons. 
Nor do we believe any spiritual purpose is served by the  precise 
method in which this washing is carried out nor will we  be bound 
by the ritualistic incantations of those who claim  knowledge of a 
traditional and preferred method.  It is not the  purpose of this 
section to yoke believers to any system of formalism or  ritualism 
or to detract from a simple, direct prayer life, as Isa  taught. 
Our purpose is to learn to pray in such an Islamic way  that 
Muslims will believe that "we have become all things  to all men 
that we might by all means save some." Moreover, we  do believe in 
demons and that we wrestle against them as  believers.  We know 
that we overcome the ruler of all demons, Shaitan, by the  blood 
of Isa--Revelation 12:11.  As we apply the water, by  faith we 
cover ourselves with the blood of Isa, the One "that  came by 
water and blood, even Isa al-Masih; not by water only,  but by 
water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth  witness, 
because the Spirit is truth."--I John 5:6-7 <a class="return" href="prayer_split_001.html#R77"> ( Return ) </a>
</p><p id="N78" class="note1"><span class="note_number">78</span> This is the call to prayer given by the Muaadhdhin,  who is 
traditionally an adult male and who stands to make the 
announcement that brings everyone to form a line behind  him on 
prayer rugs or sajajid. Each believer has already been  praying 
and meditating on Scripture before the service begins and  no one 
is talking or looking around.  The room is  reverently prepared 
for the prayer service by the prayerful concentration of  all the 
people.  Each believer should by faith see the armor  of 
Ephesians chapter 6 in front of him on his prayer carpet as the  objects he 
will use to mark off an area of space or sutra within  which he is 
not disturbed by human or demoniacal influences. <a class="return" href="prayer_split_001.html#R78"> ( Return ) </a>
</p><p id="N79" class="note1"><span class="note_number">79</span> In small mosques the Adhaan is given by the Imam or  prayer 
leader, though in larger mosques, an official is  specially 
appointed for the purpose.  In smaller mosques  lacking a minaret 
the call may be made from the side of the building or  from the 
door or from inside.  In any event, a messianic 
Muaadhdhin, focusing his intercessory heart toward the  lost 
millions facing Mecca, stands with his face turned in  their 
direction and, with the points of his thumbs by his ear  lobes, 
recites the messianic formula given here. <a class="return" href="prayer_split_001.html#R79"> ( Return ) </a>

</p><p id="N88" class="note1"><span class="note_number">88</span> When the Caller to prayer has finished, we are ready  to 
begin the service.  The Imam may come up at any  moment after the 
first Adhaan; As he approaches the three-step riser  Minbar or 
pulpit, he faces the worshippers and greets them with  "As-Salaamu 
'Alaikum"or "Peace be on you."  The  Imam then sits down facing 
the believers. The Imam gives two messages, one brief and  one 
longer with a free time of worship between them.   The sermon or 
Khutbah begins with the formula, Al hamdu lillaah  ("All praise is 
due to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  ") and may occasionally and selectively use the 
Qur'an as a bridge to illustrate the canonical truth of  the 
authoritative prophetic message given exclusively in the Holy  Scriptures, 
provided the leader roots the believers in Scripture  alone and 
does not let them drift away from memorizing and  meditating 
on the only infallible guide for faith and  practice.  At the 
conclusion of the sermon, the Imam leads the worshipers  in the 
congregational prayers.  It should be noted: all  five of the 
daily prayers have a similar structure and use the same  basic 
prayer postures of standing, bowing, sitting,  prostrating, 
lifting hands, etc.  Since the noon prayer is the  one also used 
at the weekly congregational meeting, it is offered here  as an 
example of individual five-times daily devotional prayers  useable 
by messianic Muslims in a contextualized ministry. <a class="return" href="prayer_split_001.html#R88"> ( Return ) </a>
                    </p><p id="N89" class="note1"><span class="note_number">89</span> This is the second call to the prayers or salat  which is 
pronounced by the Muaadhdhin, who may be the same person  as the 
Imam and the Imam is normally the one who gives the  sermon.  This 
second call gives the moment when the congregational  prayers 
begin.  At this point we stand for prayer and  consciously make 
the intention or niyyah to focus with the eye of our  spirit upon 
Isa the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   who promised, " Truly, Truly I say to you, 
if you shall ask the Father for anything in my name, He  will give 
it to you." See John 16:23. <a class="return" href="prayer_split_005.html#R89"> ( Return ) </a>
</p><p id="N90" class="note1"><span class="note_number">90</span> As the Muaadhdhin completes this second call to  prayer, the 
believer is standing, his hands above his shoulders, his  finger 
tips parallel to his ears, as it says "I will  therefore that men 
pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath or 
disputing."-see I Timothy 2:8. <a class="return" href="prayer_split_005.html#R90"> ( Return ) </a>

true God self-revealed as God and His Word and His  Eternal 
Spirit.  Then placing the hands between the chest  and the navel, 
with the palm of the right hand over the left, and the  wrist of 
the left hand gripped by the right hand, we grasp the  breastplate 
of righteousness, the most important part of our armor.  "Above 
all guard your heart with all diligence; for out of it  are the 
issues of life.'--see Proverbs 4:23.  If you  "believe in your 
heart that God raised him--Isa--from the dead, you shall  be 
saved.  For with the heart man believes unto righteousness"-see 
Romans 10:9-10.  Meditating on this verse, we  realize that the 
World-Judge is alive to judge all men, and that if we  believe 
this with our heart, "every man that hath this hope  in Him 
purifieth himself, even as He--Isa--is pure." See I  John 3:3 <a class="return" href="prayer_split_005.html#R99"> ( Return ) </a>
</p><p id="N100" class="note1"><span class="note_number">100</span> As we say this we remember that Isa al-Masih, the  glorious 
Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  , taught us to pray to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  , "Lead us not into 
temptation but deliver us from the Evil One."-see  Matthew 6:13. 
Then the risen and victorious Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   spoke through the 
Apostolic author of Ephesians that we must put on the  armor of 
God "always" see Ephesians 6:18--in order to  stand our ground 
against the Devil so that we may stand blameless before  the Son 
of Man--see Luke 21:36. Therefore, five times a day is  not any 
too frequent for submitters to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   to watch and pray as 
heavy-armed prayer warriors.   The Bible says  we are to pray 
without ceasing (I Thes. 5:17) <a class="return" href="prayer_split_005.html#R100"> ( Return ) </a>
</p><p id="N101" class="note1"><span class="note_number">101</span> This is the opening chapter of the Qur'an and is  recited as 
a prayer, with this in mind: <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   has designated His Word--Isa 
to be "Master of the Day of Judgment"--see  Daniel 7:13-14; 
Matthew 25:31-46. <a class="return" href="prayer_split_005.html#R101"> ( Return ) </a>
</p><p id="N102" class="note1"><span class="note_number">102</span> At the end of the recitation of Al-Faatihah, it is 
traditional for the believers to say Aameen or Amen  either aloud 
in a loud prayer or silently in a silent prayer. <a class="return" href="prayer_split_005.html#R102"> ( Return ) </a>
</p><p id="N103" class="note1"><span class="note_number">103</span> An optional portion of the Quran is traditionally  recited 
at this point. Adoration 32:12 is selected here because  it 
illustrates what it means to enter into the death of Isa.  If you 
could leave this world and see the lake of fire where the 
unbelievers in Isa will be thrown, you would not return  the same 
person.  The wickedness of this world would not have  the same 
power over you, because part of you would still be on the  other 
side gazing at the awesome lake of fire.  You would  be dead to 
sin and you would not need all kinds of religious rules  to remind 
you to be holy.  Realizing that there are only two  alternatives 
in life, either to be baptized into the eternal torment  of the 
lake of fire or to be baptized by faith into the death of  Isa, 
you would come back a believer led by the Eternal Spirit  and you 
would henceforth deal with this wicked world like a dead  man, 
dealing with it as though you had no dealings with  it--see I 
Corinthians 7:29-31.<a class="return" href="prayer_split_005.html#R103"> ( Return ) </a> 
</p><p id="N104" class="note1"><span class="note_number">104</span> At the end of this part of the prayer, the  messianic 
believer changes to the bowing position called Rukuu'u by  saying 
Allaahu Akbar or "<span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   is greatest."  Still standing, the 
believer bends forward from the torso and, with the hands 
supporting the weight of his upper body at the knees, he  remains 
standing in this bowing position as he recites the  prayers. 
However, with his hands on his knees, he is aware of the  belt of 
truth, which holds the sword of the Spirit, the Word of  God, the 
only measuring standard of authoritative prophecy and  inerrant 
words "that are able to make you wise unto salvation  through 
faith which is in Isa al-Masih.'--see II Timothy 3:15. As  the 
believer feels the blood rushing to his head, he  remembers the 
helmet of salvation which brings "every thought  captive to obey 
al-Masih."-see 11 Corinthians 10:5.  We look  neither to the left 
nor to the right, but straight ahead to Isa who is alone  the 
author and finisher of our faith--Hebrews 12:2. <a class="return" href="prayer_split_005.html#R104"> ( Return ) </a>
</p><p id="N105" class="note1"><span class="note_number">105</span> As one resumes the upright standing position called  Raf'u, 
one takes the shield of faith which is able to quench  like water 
every fiery dart from Satan that would otherwise accuse  us or 
discourage us. Then, wrapping ourselves in a garment of  praise we 
exchange the spirit of heaviness-see Isaiah 61:3--for the  joy of 
the Lord, which is our strength. <a class="return" href="prayer_split_005.html#R105"> ( Return ) </a>
</p><p id="N106" class="note1"><span class="note_number">106</span> Unconfessed sin can hinder our prayers.  Yet  we must 
remember that even when we were enemies of God, the  Messiah made 
his sacrifice of love for the ungodly.  Romans  5:7-11 <a class="return" href="prayer_split_005.html#R106"> ( Return ) </a>
</p><p id="N107" class="note1"><span class="note_number">107</span> Now one changes to the position of prostration  called 
Sujuud, with the toes of both feet, both knees, both  hands, and 
the forehead touching the ground, with the hands kept  apart from 
one's sides.  Such was the manner in which Moses,  Daniel and 
other prophets often prayed before God.  Here we put  on our feet 
the boots that equip us to go and share the Good News of  how to 
have peace with <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   through the punishment His Word Isa endured 
to freely provide for our just acquittal and  forgiveness.  As our 
toes press into the prayer carpet, we realize that the only 
reason our feet are on this earth is so that we can lead  the 
Lord's chosen people to eternal life. <a class="return" href="prayer_split_005.html#R107"> ( Return ) </a>

words or forms in any iron-clad way.  However, the  basic prayer 
postures and the structure of the prayer's beginning and  end as 
well as the five times a day regularity are all aspects  which we
