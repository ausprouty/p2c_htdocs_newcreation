<h2 class="subtitle" id="calibre_pb_10">A COSTLY DEATH AND THE INHERITANCE OF THE FATHER'S PERSONAL WORD TO HIS HEIRS</h2>

	<p class="poem">Then the father looked at him with anguished love</p>
	<p class="poem">and said,</p>
	<p class="poem">"You know the costly death a murith (testator)</p>
	<p class="poem">must somehow undergo in order that his heirs</p>
	<p class="poem">may receive all that he has.</p>
	<p class="poem">And yet you seem to love me</p>
	<p class="poem">more like a self-justifying slave</p>
	<p class="poem">than a trusting and humble son."</p>
	<p class="poem">The father put his arm around the man and said,</p>
	<p class="poem">"Are you so far away from knowing me</p>
	<p class="poem">that you cannot rejoice that the one</p>
	<p class="poem">who strayed from the fasaqa (right course)</p>
	<p class="poem">has found tajaddud (renewal)</p>
	<p class="poem">and has been rashid (rightly guided)</p>
	<p class="poem">to the marashid (salvation) of God?</p>
	<p class="poem">For like you</p>
	<p class="poem">your brother had a sajiya (natural disposition)</p>
	<p class="poem">that was dead but now he has been jadda (restored)</p>
	<p class="poem">to the abundant life of wisal (communion)</p>
	<p class="poem">as an heir of his father's house." <a class="note" id="R7" href="soil_split_015.html#N7">7</a></p>
