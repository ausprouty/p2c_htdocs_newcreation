<h2 class="subtitle" id="calibre_pb_1">A KHUTBAH (SERMON) </h2>
	<p class="calibre5">"GOD'S PLAN FOR THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND ISHMAEL"</p>
	<p class="poem">"In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.</p>
	<p class="poem">Praised be God. Praised be the God who has shown us the way, the</p>
	<p class="poem">straight path through His Word.</p>
	<p class="poem">I bear witness that there is nothing worthy of worship</p>
	<p class="poem">but God.</p>
	<p class="poem">I bear witness that Isa is the Word of God.</p>
	<p class="poem">Fear God, O you people,</p>
	<p class="poem">fear that day,</p>
	<p class="poem">the Day of Judgment,</p>
	<p class="poem">when a father will not be able to answer for his son,</p>
	<p class="poem">nor the son for his father,</p>
	<p class="poem">when an Imam will not be able to answer for a Muslim,</p>
	<p class="poem">nor a Rabbi for a Jew.</p>
	<p class="poem">O you people who have believed,</p>
	<p class="poem">turn you to God,</p>
	<p class="poem">as Ibrahim did turn to God.</p>
	<p class="poem">Truly God is One and forgives all sin through His Word.</p>
	<p class="poem">Truly we know His Word.</p>
	<p class="poem">I bear witness that Isa is His Word of forgiveness.</p>
	<p class="poem">Through Him <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  is merciful,</p>
	<p class="poem">the forgiver of sins.</p>
	<p class="poem">Through Him <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  is the most munificent,</p>
	<p class="poem">and bountiful, the King,</p>
	<p class="poem">the Holy One, the Most Merciful."</p>
	<p class="poem">(The preacher or khatib or muzakkir then descends from the</p>
	<p class="poem">pulpit, and sitting on the floor of the place of prayer, offers</p>
	<p class="poem">up a silent prayer. He then again ascends the minbar or pulpit,</p>
	<p class="poem">which may be nothing more than a small three step riser in</p>
	<p class="poem">smaller mosques and proceeds.)</p>
	<p class="poem">"In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.</p>
	<p class="poem">Praise be to God."</p>
	<p class="poem">He who has the living Word of God for His guide</p>
	<p class="poem">is never lost.</p>
	<p class="poem">If we have truly died with His Word</p>
	<p class="poem">and have truly been brought to live again by His Word,</p>
	<p class="poem">then we truly passed from death to life.</p>
	<p class="poem">There is a text in the Quran that refers to this:</p>
	<p class="poem">'Or (take) the similitude</p>
	<p class="poem">of one who passed</p>
	<p class="poem">by a hamlet, all in ruins,</p>
	<p class="poem">to its roofs. He said:</p>
	<p class="poem">'Oh! how shall <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">bring it (ever) to life,</p>
	<p class="poem">after (this) its death?'</p>
	<p class="poem">Then in that same text (Cow 2:259)</p>
	<p class="poem">it says:</p>
	<p class="poem">'Look further at the bones,</p>
	<p class="poem">how We bring them together,</p>
	<p class="poem">and clothe them with flesh!'</p>
	<p class="poem">Many commentators believe this text</p>
	<p class="poem">is referring to Ezekiel 37:1-1O,</p>
	<p class="poem">which says,</p>
	<p class="poem">"The hand of the Lord was upon me (Ezekiel),</p>
	<p class="poem">and carried me out in the Spirit of the Lord,</p>
	<p class="poem">and set me down in the midst of the valley</p>
	<p class="poem">which was full of bones,</p>
	<p class="poem">and caused me to pass by them round about:</p>
	<p class="poem">and, behold, there were very many in the open valley;</p>
	<p class="poem">and, lo, they were very dry.</p>
	<p class="poem">And he (God) said to me,</p>
	<p class="poem">'Son of man, can these bones live?'</p>
	<p class="poem">And I answered,</p>
	<p class="poem">'O Lord God, thou knowest.'</p>
	<p class="poem">Again he said unto me,</p>
	<p class="poem">Prophesy upon these bones,</p>
	<p class="poem">and say unto them,</p>
	<p class="poem">O you dry bones,</p>
	<p class="poem">hear the word of the Lord.</p>
	<p class="poem">Thus saith the Lord God unto these bones;</p>
	<p class="poem">Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you,</p>
	<p class="poem">and you shall live:</p>
	<p class="poem">And I will lay sinews upon you,</p>
	<p class="poem">and will bring up flesh upon you,</p>
	<p class="poem">and cover you with skin,</p>
	<p class="poem">and put breath in you,</p>
	<p class="poem">and you shall live;</p>
	<p class="poem">and you shall know that I am the Lord.'</p>
	<p class="poem">So I (Ezekiel) prophesied as I was commanded:</p>
	<p class="poem">and as I prophesied,</p>
	<p class="poem">there was a noise,</p>
	<p class="poem">and behold a shaking,</p>
	<p class="poem">and the bones came together,</p>
	<p class="poem">bone to his bone.</p>
	<p class="poem">And when I beheld, lo,</p>
	<p class="poem">the sinews and the flesh came up upon them,</p>
	<p class="poem">and the skin covered them above:</p>
	<p class="poem">but there was no breath in them.</p>
	<p class="poem">Then said he unto me,</p>
	<p class="poem">'Prophesy unto the wind,</p>
	<p class="poem">prophesy, son of man,</p>
	<p class="poem">and say to the wind,</p>
	<p class="poem">Thus saith the Lord God;</p>
	<p class="poem">Come from the four winds, O breath,</p>
	<p class="poem">and breathe upon these slain, that</p>
	<p class="poem">they may live.'</p>
	<p class="poem">So I prophesied as he (God) commanded me,</p>
	<p class="poem">and the breath came into them,</p>
	<p class="poem">and they lived,</p>
	<p class="poem">and stood up upon their feet,</p>
	<p class="poem">an exceeding great army."</p>
	<p class="poem">What is this passage talking about?</p>
	<p class="poem">Is there somewhere a great army</p>
	<p class="poem">of those who were once dead</p>
	<p class="poem">but are now being brought to life again?</p>
	<p class="poem">Are we who are New Creation Muslims included or excluded</p>
	<p class="poem">from that prophesied army?</p>
	<p class="poem">We Muslims are always asking questions like this.</p>
	<p class="poem">We always wonder if God is including us.</p>
	<p class="poem">The most pressing problem we Muslims have</p>
	<p class="poem">is our spiritual identity.</p>
	<p class="poem">The solution to that identity problem</p>
	<p class="poem">has been given to us in the ancient past</p>
	<p class="poem">through Ibrahim and Ishmael.</p>
	<p class="poem">But many anti-Muslim teachers and preachers</p>
	<p class="poem">use the Bible to teach political interpretations</p>
	<p class="poem">about the promise of the land to Ibrahim</p>
	<p class="poem">and negative interpretations about Ishmael.</p>
	<p class="poem">So many Muslims ask,</p>
	<p class="poem">"Why is it asserted that <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  loves the Jews</p>
	<p class="poem">as his chosen people more than he loves us Muslims?</p>
	<p class="poem">Why do so many want to twist the Scriptures</p>
	<p class="poem">to make us feel rejected?"</p>
	<p class="poem">But if we begin with the Taurat,</p>
	<p class="poem">B'raisheet (Genesis) chapter 15,</p>
	<p class="poem">we return to the cornerstone of our faith</p>
	<p class="poem">as new creation submitters to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">and that cornerstone is Ibrahim.</p>
	<p class="poem">It says, "Ibrahim believed God,"</p>
	<p class="poem">and consequently it says that it was credited to him</p>
	<p class="poem">that he became a righteous submitter to the true path.</p>
