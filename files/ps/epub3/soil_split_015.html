	<p id="N1" class="note1"><span class="note_number">1</span> This account is found in the first book of the Torah 
(Taurat), chapter 18.  The material in the text  above is intended 
to be read by Muslims; however, the footnotes are also  directed 
toward those who may need additional information, because  they 
are inexperienced in identifying with people of Muslim 
background. <a class="return" href="soil_split_001.html#R1"> ( Return ) </a>
</p><p id="N2" class="note1"><span class="note_number">2</span> A harbi is a non-Muslim living in territory ruled by 
non-Muslims. <a class="return" href="soil_split_006.html#R2"> ( Return ) </a>
</p><p id="N3" class="note1"><span class="note_number">3</span> A sacrifice without blemish is traditionally required  for 
every free Muslim at the climax of the pilgrimage that is  to be 
taken at least once in a lifetime, and the sacrifice is  made and 
shared in a communion meal at the time of the major  festival even 
by those who do not make the pilgrimage. <a class="return" href="soil_split_008.html#R3"> ( Return ) </a>
</p><p id="N4" class="note1"><span class="note_number">4</span> Why does the text use "God" sometimes and  "<span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>" other 
times?  Because the elder brother is presented as a  Muslim in the 
story, and as a Muslim he would naturally favor the  Arabic word 
for "God."  The word "God" is  translated "<span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>" in Arabic which 
is Tetragrammaton written in Arabic letters.  See 
also notes #8 and #239 below.  <a class="return" href="soil_split_009.html#R4"> ( Return ) </a>
</p><p id="N5" class="note1"><span class="note_number">5</span> Kalim is the Quranic term for "word."   Since Isa is called 
<span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>'s Word in the Quran 4:171 and since he is  also the personal 
Word who took the form of a servant, the word choice is  important 
here in English.  Some of these parenthetical words  are cues to 
the Arabic translator and some are added for  nuance.  This book 
is available, as supplies last, in Arabic from AFII P.O.  BOX 2056 
NEW YORK NY 10163 USA.  However, donations are  needed to reprint 
it at this time.  Artists For Israel is a  not-for-profit 
publishing ministry dependent on donations from believers  as the 
only source of financial aid in reprinting literature and 
distributing it at cost or free-of-charge.  http://www.afii.org<a class="return" href="soil_split_010.html#R5"> ( Return ) </a>

Arabic translator.  <a class="return" href="soil_split_010.html#R6"> ( Return ) </a>

published by Concordia, dramatizing how a Muslim might see  the 
Cross of Christ in Luke 15.  <a class="return" href="soil_split_011.html#R7"> ( Return ) </a>
</p><p id="N8" class="note1"><span class="note_number">8</span> Family of 'Imran. 3:49.  All references in  English are from 
A. Yusuf Ali: The Holy Qur'an, first published  1934.  Those who, 
for whatever reason, object to the frequent references to  the 
Qur'an in this book should remember that Paul quotes  "one of 
their prophets" verbatim in order to win the  citizens of Crete 
when what "one of their prophets" said lines up  with the Word. 
See Titus 1: 12-13.  This book follows, if we may sound  a note of 
irony, the rather "unorthodox" route of Pauline  methodology.  <a class="return" href="soil_split_012.html#R8"> ( Return ) </a>

show that the scribal transcription has been trustworthy  enough 
to insure that the original message has not been lost,  for "none

تيتراغراماتون</span>'s Words" (Cave 18:27).  The Arab  Bedouin child 
who found (near the Dead Sea at Qumran) the scroll of  Isaiah, the 
most important prophet of both the Hebrew and the New  Testament 
Bible, provided the world with scientific proof that the  Bible 
has not been corrupted and lost.  For this  two-thousand year old 
perfectly preserved scroll matches our own version,  proving that 
the original has not been lost in scribal transcription.  <a class="return" href="soil_split_014.html#R13"> ( Return ) </a>
