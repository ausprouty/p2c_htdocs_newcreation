	<p class="poem">Now it was the tenth day</p>
	<p class="poem">of the month of Hajj (Pilgrimage),</p>
	<p class="poem">but the elder son, having a self-satisfied heart,</p>
	<p class="poem">had some time before decided to forego the trip.</p>
	<p class="poem">But when the younger son was yet a long way off,</p>
	<p class="poem">his father saw him.</p>
	<p class="poem">And greatly moved with love and compassion,</p>
	<p class="poem">his father ran to the younger son</p>
	<p class="poem">and clasped him in his arms</p>
	<p class="poem">and kissed him with tenderness.</p>
	<p class="poem">And the younger son said to him,</p>
	<p class="poem">"Father, I have sinned against heaven</p>
	<p class="poem">and in your sight,</p>
	<p class="poem">and I am no longer worthy to be called your son."</p>
	<p class="poem">But the father said to his hired servants,</p>
	<p class="poem">"Bring forth the best robe</p>
	<p class="poem">and put it on him;</p>
	<p class="poem">and put a ring on his hand</p>
	<p class="poem">and shoes on his feet;</p>
	<p class="poem">and bring the calf we have been fattening and kill it;</p>
	<p class="poem">we are going to have</p>
	<p class="poem">a Qurban (Sacrifice) as on 'Id al-Adha <a class="note" id="R3" href="soil_split_015.html#N3">3</a></p>
	<p class="poem">such as has not been since the time Ibrahim</p>
	<p class="poem">celebrated the redemption of his son.</p>
	<p class="poem">Because this son of mine was dead</p>
	<p class="poem">and has come back to life;</p>
	<p class="poem">he was lost</p>
	<p class="poem">and now he has been found."</p>
	<p class="poem">And the great feast began.</p>
