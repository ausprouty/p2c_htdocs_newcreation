<h2 class="subtitle" id="calibre_pb_2">THE TRUE STORY OF AHMAD</h2>
                    <p class="poem">The secret ceremony that Judas was too afraid</p>
<p class="poem">to get really involved in was called the Lord's Supper,</p>
<p class="poem">but we call it the 'Id ul-'Adha of Isa,</p>
<p class="poem">because of its deep relationship to pilgrimage</p>
<p class="poem">and covenant and submission to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   through Ibrahim</p>
<p class="poem">and the sacrifice of heir.</p>
<p class="poem">But what a fool Judas was!</p>
<p class="poem">He would have died anyway,</p>
<p class="poem">and very shortly at that in this dangerous world.</p>
<p class="poem">If only he had made the brief time left to him</p>
<p class="poem">in his fleeting life</p>
<p class="poem">a brave witness for Isa</p>
<p class="poem">by fully taking part in this secret ceremony,</p>
<p class="poem">instead of cowardly avoiding it.</p>
<p class="poem">Now he must spend endless ages in the anguish of hell.</p>
<p class="poem">So what did he save?</p>
<p class="poem">Did he save his life through cowardice?</p>
<p class="poem"><span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   forbid that any of our Muslim brothers</p>
<p class="poem">should refuse to receive Isa as the Word of<span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
</p>
<p class="poem">because they are too cowardly to obey his commandment</p>
<p class="poem">to submit to the sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  .</p>
<p class="poem">Endless ages from now,</p>
<p class="poem">when they groan in endless anguish,</p>
<p class="poem">they will regret forever</p>
<p class="poem">this cowardly error.<a class="note" href="notes.html#N260">260</a></p>
<p class="poem">Here is the testimony of Ahmad,</p>
<p class="poem">whom God gave the grace not to be cowardly.</p>
<p class="poem">This is a true testimony</p>
<p class="poem">in his own words.</p>
