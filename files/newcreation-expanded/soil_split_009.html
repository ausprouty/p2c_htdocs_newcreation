<h2 class="subtitle" id="calibre_pb_8">THE ELDER SON REFUSES TO FORSAKE A SELF-RIGHTEOUS AND PROUD RELIGIOUS SPIRIT</h2>
	<p class="poem">Now the elder brother</p>
	<p class="poem">had just returned from the mosque,</p>
	<p class="poem">and, on his way back, as he drew near the house,</p>
	<p class="poem">he could hear the sounds of the wisal (communion)</p>
	<p class="poem">of the father and his younger son.</p>
	<p class="poem">Calling one of the hired servants,</p>
	<p class="poem">the elder brother asked what all this was about.</p>
	<p class="poem">And the hired servant said to the elder son,</p>
	<p class="poem">"Your brother has returned safe and salim (sound)</p>
	<p class="poem">and your father has personally sent word</p>
	<p class="poem">for the Qurban (sacrifice) and the festivities to begin."</p>
	<p class="poem">Now the elder brother was furious</p>
	<p class="poem">and refused to go in.</p>
	<p class="poem">He would have nothing</p>
	<p class="poem">to do with this sort of din (religious practice).</p>
	<p class="poem">Would God act like his father? <a class="note" id="R4" href="soil_split_015.html#N4">4</a></p>
	<p class="poem">Would <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> bestow a matwaba (reward) on a son</p>
	<p class="poem">with an innate qariha (disposition)</p>
	<p class="poem">that was asin (rebellious)?</p>
	<p class="poem">And not only that, one who had no tawab (merit)</p>
	<p class="poem">because he had done absolutely no good deeds</p>
	<p class="poem">or ihsan (right conduct)</p>
	<p class="poem">--would <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> act like this sort of father?</p>
	<p class="poem">The elder brother resolved to never be like such a one</p>
	<p class="poem">and he sat down and brooded in the outer darkness.</p>
