	<p class="poem">Imagine a farmer going out to plant seed.</p>
	<p class="poem">As the farmer planted the seed,</p>
	<p class="poem">some fell on the edge of the path,</p>
	<p class="poem">and the birds came and ate those seeds up.</p>
	<p class="poem">Others fell on rocky soil</p>
	<p class="poem">where they sprang up quickly;</p>
	<p class="poem">but as soon as the sun came up,</p>
	<p class="poem">those that were rootless and shallow plantings</p>
	<p class="poem">soon withered away.</p>
	<p class="poem">Other seeds fell among thorns</p>
	<p class="poem">which grew up and choked them.</p>
	<p class="poem">Finally, there were seeds that fell on rich soil</p>
	<p class="poem">and these seeds multiplied themselves</p>
	<p class="poem">in the fruit they produced--</p>
	<p class="poem">some a hundred times over,</p>
	<p class="poem">some sixty times over,</p>
	<p class="poem">some thirty.</p>
