<h2 class="subtitle" id="calibre_pb_8"><span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  BOUND UP THE EVIL ONE</h2>
	<p class="poem">The man of God knew that the Kingdom of God</p>
	<p class="poem">is an ummah, (community) <a id="R28" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N28">28</a></p>
	<p class="poem">a house to be entered</p>
	<p class="poem">by the narrow gate and the narrow door,</p>
	<p class="poem">But a "strong man" has usurped power in God's House.</p>
	<p class="poem">Iblis (an evil prince) has held men captive</p>
	<p class="poem">in the house of God,</p>
	<p class="poem">and Iblis must have his goods plundered</p>
	<p class="poem">before men can be set free from his sway.</p>
	<p class="poem">The power of Iblis is death,</p>
	<p class="poem">for all men who are tempted and sin</p>
	<p class="poem">die as punishment.</p>
	<p class="poem">Sin pays its fearful wage--death.</p>
	<p class="poem">Death is the fearful wage of all those</p>
	<p class="poem">whom Shaitan has led to work for him in sin.</p>
	<p class="poem">Therefore, only by plundering the goods of the strongman:</p>
	<p class="poem">that is, by taking away his power</p>
	<p class="poem">to enslave men in the fear of death</p>
	<p class="poem">and his power to tempt men to destruction,</p>
	<p class="poem">according to the law of sin and death</p>
	<p class="poem">-only by plundering these goods</p>
	<p class="poem">could the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  defeat Iblis.</p>
	<p class="poem">Thus it says of the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> , Isa,</p>
	<p class="poem">that "by his death he could take away all the powerof the devil,</p>
	<p class="poem">who had power over death."</p>
	<p class="poem">"The Good News that the man of God proclaimed</p>
	<p class="poem">is this very power,</p>
	<p class="poem">the power of spiritual life over spiritual death,</p>
	<p class="poem">the power that delivers us from every evil</p>
	<p class="poem">and will soon rescue us from the presence of wickedness</p>
	<p class="poem">when all things shall be subdued unto the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">and the Word Himself also shall be subject unto Him</p>
	<p class="poem">that put all things under His Word,</p>
	<p class="poem">that <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  may be All in All exalted. <a id="R29" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N29">29</a></p>
	<p class="poem">But when the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> , Isa, returns,</p>
	<p class="poem">shall He find faith on the earth?</p>
	<p class="poem">For many of the Jewish people did not believe his report;  and</p>
	<p class="poem">since the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  did not reign in their hearts  he was</p>
	<p class="poem">despised and rejected as their king,</p>
	<p class="poem">and they esteemed not his kingdom.</p>
	<p class="poem">"But when they said (in boast)</p>
	<p class="poem">'We killed Isa al-Masih,</p>
	<p class="poem">the son of Mary,</p>
	<p class="poem">the Messenger of God,'</p>
	<p class="poem">they killed him not,</p>
	<p class="poem">nor crucified him,</p>
	<p class="poem">but so it was made</p>
	<p class="poem">to appear to them..."<a id="R30" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N30">30</a></p>
	<p class="poem">It only appeared</p>
	<p class="poem">that men and not God determined His death.</p>
	<p class="poem">For "it pleased the Lord to crush Him!"</p>
	<p class="poem">God it was "who caused him to suffer,"</p>
	<p class="poem">as the prophet foretold. <a id="R31" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N31">31</a></p>
	<p class="poem">Isa al-Masih Himself confessed and denied not,</p>
	<p class="poem">"No man taketh my life from me,</p>
	<p class="poem">but I lay it down of my own free will,</p>
	<p class="poem">and as it is in my power to lay my life down,</p>
	<p class="poem">so it is in my power to take it up again."(John10:18)</p>
	<p class="poem">Did you not know that the Word of God willingly died?</p>
	<p class="poem">For this end was He born</p>
	<p class="poem">and for this cause did He die</p>
	<p class="poem">and for this alone did God send Him into the world.</p>
	<p class="poem">God so loved the world</p>
	<p class="poem">that He gave His only living Word</p>
	<p class="poem">as a sin-covering sacrifice,</p>
	<p class="poem">"a momentous sacrifice,"</p>
	<p class="poem">as it reads in the saying,</p>
	<p class="poem">"Behold!  God said:</p>
	<p class="poem">'O Jesus!  I will take thee</p>
	<p class="poem">and I (raise) thee to Myself...'" <a id="R32" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N32">32</a>.</p>
	<p class="poem">Have you not read that the Jewish people</p>
	<p class="poem">promised <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">"not to believe in a Messenger</p>
	<p class="poem">unless He showed us a sacrifice" <a id="R33" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N33">33</a>?</p>
	<p class="poem">And have you not read that <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">who is rich in mercy,</p>
	<p class="poem">for His great love wherewith He loved us</p>
	<p class="poem">even when we were dead in sins</p>
	<p class="poem">(like sheep led to the slaughter,</p>
	<p class="poem">like Ibrahim's son led to the slaughter),</p>
	<p class="poem">that <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> <span lang="AR-SA">  </span>so loved the world</p>
	<p class="poem">that he ransomed Ibrahim's doomed progeny</p>
	<p class="poem">--"and We ransomed him with a momentous sacrifice"? <a id="R34" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N34">34</a></p>
	<p class="poem">Are you ignorant of the prophecy of Isaiah</p>
	<p class="poem">(sealed incorruptibly in the Dead Sea Scrolls</p>
	<p class="poem">and fulfilled 700 years later</p>
	<p class="poem">in the death of Isa al-Masih):</p>
	<p class="poem">"Yet it was the Lord's will to crush him</p>
	<p class="poem">and cause him to suffer,</p>
	<p class="poem">and though the Lord makes his life</p>
	<p class="poem">a sacrifice offering for sin,</p>
	<p class="poem">he (the Masih) will see his (spiritual) progeny,</p>
	<p class="poem">he shall prolong his days,</p>
	<p class="poem">and the will of the Lord</p>
	<p class="poem">will prosper in his hand.</p>
	<p class="poem">The suffering of his soul,</p>
	<p class="poem">He will see and be satisfied</p>
	<p class="poem">by his knowledge my righteous servant <a id="R35" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N35">35</a></p>
	<p class="poem">will make many righteous,</p>
	<p class="poem">taking their faults on himself <a id="R36" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N36">36</a>.</p>
	<p class="poem">Are we, then, not that doomed progeny of Ibrahim?</p>
	<p class="poem">"No indeed.</p>
	<p class="poem"><span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  raised him (Jesus) up unto Himself <a id="R37" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N37">37</a></p>
	<p class="poem">And <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  has brought us</p>
	<p class="poem">spiritually alive together with Isa</p>
	<p class="poem">(by grace we are saved)</p>
	<p class="poem">and has raised us up together</p>
	<p class="poem">as the spiritual progeny of Ibrahim</p>
	<p class="poem">and made us sit together</p>
	<p class="poem">in the triumph of his eternal ummah (community).</p>
	<p class="poem">Therefore, when the iniquity</p>
	<p class="poem">of this present world is complete,</p>
	<p class="poem">this same living Word</p>
	<p class="poem">who was taken up to heaven</p>
	<p class="poem">shall also come again</p>
	<p class="poem">in like manner as He went.</p>
	<p class="poem">And then it shall be as it says,</p>
	<p class="poem">"The Day the heaven is split asunder with the clouds,</p>
	<p class="poem">and the angels are sent down in ranks,</p>
	<p class="poem">that day, the kingdom, the true kingdom, shall belong</p>
	<p class="poem">to the All-merciful, and it shall be a day</p>
	<p class="poem">harsh for the unbelievers"...<a id="R38" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N38">38</a></p>
	<p class="poem">"And (Isa) shall be</p>
	<p class="poem">a Sign (for the coming of) the Hour (of Judgment):</p>
	<p class="poem">Therefore have no doubt about the (Hour)"...<a id="R39" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N39">39</a></p>
	<p class="poem">"And thy Lord shall come with angels,</p>
	<p class="poem">rank on rank." (Daybreak 89:22)</p>
	<p class="poem">On that day the Word of God will fight.</p>
	<p class="poem">That will be the day of his jihad, his holy war.</p>
	<p class="poem">And the Word of God will slay al-Masih al-Daajjal,</p>
	<p class="poem">the False Messiah, and his lying prophet,</p>
	<p class="poem">together with all who have lying visions</p>
	<p class="poem">and all who consult them</p>
	<p class="poem">or have come bringing a different doctrine</p>
	<p class="poem">that is not the teaching of Isa al-Masih.</p>
	<p class="poem">On that day it shall be as was seen</p>
	<p class="poem">by Yahya, (John) one of Isa's hawari rusul (apostles):</p>
	<p class="poem">"And I saw heaven opened,</p>
	<p class="poem">and behold a white horse;</p>
	<p class="poem">and He that sat upon it was called</p>
	<p class="poem">Faithful and True,</p>
	<p class="poem">and in righteousness He doth judge and make war.</p>
	<p class="poem">His eyes were as a flame of fire</p>
	<p class="poem">and on His head were many crowns;</p>
	<p class="poem">and He had a name written,</p>
	<p class="poem">that no man knew, but He Himself.</p>
	<p class="poem">And He was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood:</p>
	<p class="poem">and His name is called</p>
	<p class="poem">The Word of God." (Revelation 19:11-13)</p>
	<p class="poem">This same Word is coming again</p>
	<p class="poem">with the armies of the angels of God.</p>
	<p class="poem">He is coming to punish the unbelieving wicked</p>
	<p class="poem">and to save the faithful who endure to the end.</p>
	<p class="poem">So then the Kingdom will be the Lord's.</p>
	<p class="poem">Therefore, if death entered humanity</p>
	<p class="poem">by the sin of the first man,</p>
	<p class="poem">life from the dead entered humanity</p>
	<p class="poem">by the righteousness of the new man,</p>
	<p class="poem">the Word of God,</p>
	<p class="poem">who came as a man</p>
	<p class="poem">to bind Shaitan and plunder his goods</p>
	<p class="poem">by offering a death that would free all men</p>
	<p class="poem">from the fear of death,</p>
	<p class="poem">from the power of death,</p>
	<p class="poem">from the realm of death,</p>
	<p class="poem">from the law of death.</p>
	<p class="poem">For whoever believes in Isa the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">will not see the death</p>
	<p class="poem">reserved for Shaitan,</p>
	<p class="poem">the second death,</p>
	<p class="poem">in the lake of fire.</p>
	<p class="poem">For since one man died in the place of all</p>
	<p class="poem">all then died in that one man,</p>
	<p class="poem">and Shaitan now has no dominion over those</p>
	<p class="poem">who overcome him by the blood of the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> ,</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa al-Masih.</p>
	<p class="poem">Such are they who overcome Shaitan by the good confession</p>
	<p class="poem">of their testimony to the grace of Isa al-Masih</p>
	<p class="poem">who saves us from the second death in the lake of fire.</p>
	<p class="poem">It was then that the man of God saw the mystery</p>
	<p class="poem">of how to fight Shaitan.</p>
	<p class="poem">This is the mystery of the narrow door</p>
	<p class="poem">into the House of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> .</p>
	<p class="poem">This is the small gate</p>
	<p class="poem">into the Kingdom of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> .</p>
	<p class="poem">It is the blood of the Word,</p>
	<p class="poem">it is the death of Isa al-Masih</p>
	<p class="poem">and few there be who find it.</p>
	<p class="poem">For Isa himself said,</p>
	<p class="poem">"Enter through the narrow gate.</p>
	<p class="poem">For wide is the gate</p>
	<p class="poem">and broad is the road</p>
	<p class="poem">that leads to destruction,</p>
	<p class="poem">and many enter through it.</p>
	<p class="poem">But small is the gate</p>
	<p class="poem">and narrow the road</p>
	<p class="poem">that leads to life,</p>
	<p class="poem">and only a few find it." (Matthew 7:13)</p>
