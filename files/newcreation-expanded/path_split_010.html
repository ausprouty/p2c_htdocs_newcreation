<h2 class="subtitle" id="calibre_pb_9"><span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  SHOWS THE MAN OF GOD HOW TO FIGHT SHAITAN</h2>
	<p class="poem">After Ahmad telephoned the man of God</p>
	<p class="poem">to tell about Isha consulting the false murshid (spiritual guide)</p>
	<p class="poem">and his "Spiritual Master light beings,"</p>
	<p class="poem">the man of God went to bed and fell into a deep sleep.</p>
	<p class="poem">About three o'clock in the morning</p>
	<p class="poem">a voice spoke to the man of God.</p>
	<p class="poem">It spoke so loud the man of God woke up instantly</p>
	<p class="poem">and was wide awake.</p>
	<p class="poem">It was a deeply resonant, masculine,</p>
	<p class="poem">and yet feminine-sounding voice</p>
	<p class="poem">and it said only one short syllable,</p>
	<p class="poem">an ugly little word</p>
	<p class="poem">the man of God didn't recognize.</p>
	<p class="poem">Nevertheless, it blasted in his ears</p>
	<p class="poem">and woke him up.</p>
	<p class="poem">The man of God opened his eyes,</p>
	<p class="poem">and the whole room where he had been sleeping</p>
	<p class="poem">was pulsating with a scarlet light,</p>
	<p class="poem">as brilliant as a strobe light.</p>
	<p class="poem">The room was normally pitch black</p>
	<p class="poem">at three o'clock in the morning</p>
	<p class="poem">but now everything in the room was brightly visible.</p>
	<p class="poem">The man of God stood up</p>
	<p class="poem">to make sure he was awake.</p>
	<p class="poem">The awesome light of this</p>
	<p class="poem">definite supernatural visitation continued.</p>
	<p class="poem">Then the Lord seemed to speak</p>
	<p class="poem">to the man of God in a very still small voice,</p>
	<p class="poem">"This is the demon she prays to.</p>
	<p class="poem">Cover yourself with the blood of my Word Isa." <a id="R40" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N40">40</a></p>
	<p class="poem">The man of God instantly saw the nature</p>
	<p class="poem">of the spiritual struggle:</p>
	<p class="poem">the demon was attacking the man of God</p>
	<p class="poem">because Isha was his property</p>
	<p class="poem">and this devil was protecting his goods.</p>
	<p class="poem">The man of God said these simple words with faith,</p>
	<p class="poem">"I cover myself with the blood of Isa."</p>
	<p class="poem">Immediately the pulsating light faded."</p>
	<p class="poem">"Resist the Devil," it says somewhere;</p>
	<p class="poem">"overcome him by the confession of your faith in Isa</p>
	<p class="poem">and by the blood of Isa,</p>
	<p class="poem">and he will flee from you."</p>
	<p class="poem">The man of God lay down and closed his eyes.</p>
	<p class="poem">Immediately he saw</p>
	<p class="poem">with the vision given him by the Eternal Spirit of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">a package in the house of Isha and Ahmad.</p>
	<p class="poem">The indwelling Spirit of God</p>
	<p class="poem">impressed on the mind of the man of God</p>
	<p class="poem">that he should call Ahmad on the telephone right then</p>
	<p class="poem">and tell him to go back into his house,</p>
	<p class="poem">taking dominion over it room by room,</p>
	<p class="poem">covering the realm of his dominion</p>
	<p class="poem">with the blood of the halifa (agent in charge) of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>,</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> .</p>
	<p class="poem">It was especially impressed on the man of God</p>
	<p class="poem">that Ahmad was to cover his wife Isha</p>
	<p class="poem">with the blood of the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">and get that horrible package of occult materials</p>
	<p class="poem">out of their house.</p>
	<p class="poem">Whatever was in that package,</p>
	<p class="poem">whether it was charms made out of pieces of writing</p>
	<p class="poem">or hair-cuttings or nail-trimmings or the hand of Fatima</p>
	<p class="poem">or knots or magic or material for sorcery</p>
	<p class="poem">or any other wicked thing,</p>
	<p class="poem">whether it was any curse or blessing</p>
	<p class="poem">thought to ward off the evil eye,</p>
	<p class="poem">any practice or object that grieves the Eternal Spirit of<span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">--these must all be curtailed and destroyed;</p>
	<p class="poem">as it says,</p>
	<p class="poem">"...Thou canst not stand before thine enemies,</p>
	<p class="poem">(until) ye take away the accursed thing from among you." <a id="R41" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N41">41</a></p>
	<p class="poem">Whoever puts his hand to the plow</p>
	<p class="poem">but then keeps looking back at this Satanic wickedness</p>
	<p class="poem">is not fit for the Kingdom of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> .</p>
	<p class="poem">It would be better to enter heaven with nothing</p>
	<p class="poem">than to enter hell with all these filthy possessions.</p>
	<p class="poem">For without holiness no man will see God.</p>
	<p class="poem">And if you leave the door open by keeping this filth</p>
	<p class="poem">in your possession,</p>
	<p class="poem">any demon that is cast out will go and find seven other demons</p>
	<p class="poem">and come back to drag you down to hell.</p>
	<p class="poem">The man of God obeyed the Lord.</p>
	<p class="poem">Even though it was not yet four o'clock in the morning,</p>
	<p class="poem">the man of God called Ahmad and woke him up.</p>
	<p class="poem">The man of God covered him</p>
	<p class="poem">with the blood of the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">and called out to God, interceding for him on the  telephone.</p>
	<p class="poem">When Ahmad heard what had happened to the man of God</p>
	<p class="poem">he realized that this demon who had taken over his house,</p>
	<p class="poem">who was destroying the peace of his family</p>
	<p class="poem">and unsettling his children,</p>
	<p class="poem">this demon who was oppressing his wife,</p>
	<p class="poem">this same demon was trying to frighten the man of God</p>
	<p class="poem">away from saving their home.</p>
	<p class="poem">Ahmad also promised the man of God</p>
	<p class="poem">that he would not sign the divorce papers</p>
	<p class="poem">that very day as his wife had requested.</p>
	<p class="poem">The admonition is clear:</p>
	<p class="poem">"Pray at all times in the Spirit."</p>
	<p class="poem">To pray in the Spirit means to pray in the power of the Spirit,</p>
	<p class="poem">with the gifts of the Spirit potentially in evidence.</p>
	<p class="poem">When the man of God saw the package,</p>
	<p class="poem">it was by means of a gift of the Eternal Spirit of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> ;</p>
	<p class="poem">namely, supernatural "knowledge" <a id="R42" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N42">42</a></p>
	<p class="poem">--that is, supernaturally provided knowledge</p>
	<p class="poem">that he could not acquire by means of his natural mind.</p>
	<p class="poem">"For we are not battling</p>
	<p class="poem">against personalities made of flesh and blood,</p>
	<p class="poem">but against beings without bodies</p>
	<p class="poem">-the evil overlords of the unseen world,</p>
	<p class="poem">those mighty demonic beings</p>
	<p class="poem">and great evil rulers of darkness who dominate this world;  and</p>
	<p class="poem">against hordes of wicked spirits</p>
	<p class="poem">in the spirit world."<a id="R43" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N43">43</a></p>
