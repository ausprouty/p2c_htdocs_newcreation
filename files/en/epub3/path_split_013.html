<h2 class="subtitle" id="calibre_pb_12">THE NEED FOR A NEW HUMAN NATURE</h2>
	<p class="poem">From such thinking came</p>
	<p class="poem">the Primal Lapse:</p>
	<p class="poem">when the first human ears</p>
	<p class="poem">were tickled with the taunt,</p>
	<p class="poem">"Hath God said...?"</p>
	<p class="poem">It was then that Shaitan (Satan)</p>
	<p class="poem">that ancient Gnostic <a id="R57" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N57">57</a></p>
	<p class="poem">boasted of knowledge higher than</p>
	<p class="poem">the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">and tempted mankind to islam (submit) to his will</p>
	<p class="poem">rather than to the will of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> .</p>
	<p class="poem">Thus mankind gave up</p>
	<p class="poem">the true and living Eternal Word</p>
	<p class="poem">for a death-dealing Satanic caricature</p>
	<p class="poem">a false Word,</p>
	<p class="poem">a devilish Word,</p>
	<p class="poem">another Message.</p>
	<p class="poem">It was then that a heart,</p>
	<p class="poem">made good by God,</p>
	<p class="poem">turned devilishly perverse.</p>
	<p class="poem">It was then that humanity,</p>
	<p class="poem">by presuming it could know good and evil</p>
	<p class="poem">and find life</p>
	<p class="poem">by some means other than islam (submission)</p>
	<p class="poem">to the true and living Word of God,</p>
	<p class="poem">fell.</p>
	<p class="poem">Yes, humanity fell,</p>
	<p class="poem">and how great was the fall of it!</p>
	<p class="poem">So great indeed</p>
	<p class="poem">that those with fallen minds</p>
	<p class="poem">unrenewed by the Eternal Spirit</p>
	<p class="poem">and the personal Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">are themselves blind to the Fall,</p>
	<p class="poem">even though their own warped thinking</p>
	<p class="poem">is part of the Fall's debris!</p>
	<p class="poem">What more evidence for the Fall do I need</p>
	<p class="poem">than my own fallen life?</p>
	<p class="poem">The heart of man is desperately wicked,</p>
	<p class="poem">who can know it?</p>
	<p class="poem">For the honest man who looks</p>
	<p class="poem">within the depths of his soul</p>
	<p class="poem">will say this:</p>
	<p class="poem">I fail to carry out the good I know I should do</p>
	<p class="poem">and I find myself doing the very things I hate.</p>
	<p class="poem">When I act against my own intention</p>
	<p class="poem">that means that I have a self that knows the good,</p>
	<p class="poem">and so the thing behaving wickedly in me</p>
	<p class="poem">must surely be my fallen nature.</p>
	<p class="poem">I know of nothing good living in me.</p>
	<p class="poem">My lower nature is my unspiritual self,</p>
	<p class="poem">possessing only a faint and fickle wish</p>
	<p class="poem">to do what is good</p>
	<p class="poem">but not the effecting will</p>
	<p class="poem">(only those who are new creations in Isa the saving Word</p>
	<p class="poem">have the effecting will</p>
	<p class="poem">with the tender conscience.<a id="R58" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N58">58</a></p>
	<p class="poem">What is the result then?</p>
	<p class="poem">Instead of doing the right</p>
	<p class="poem">I want to do,</p>
	<p class="poem">I carry out the wicked wrong</p>
	<p class="poem">I do not want.</p>
	<p class="poem">When I act against my intention, then,</p>
	<p class="poem">it is not I alone who am the agent,</p>
	<p class="poem">but the fallen nature</p>
	<p class="poem">that lodges in me.</p>
	<p class="poem">Wretched rebel that I am,</p>
	<p class="poem">who is there to rescue me out of this fallen flesh <a id="R59" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N59">59</a></p>
	<p class="poem">this treacherous will,</p>
	<p class="poem">this rebel nature doomed to death?</p>
	<p class="poem">How can I become a true muslim (submitter) to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">and receive a new creation nature?</p>
	<p class="poem">This is the question of all questions.</p>
