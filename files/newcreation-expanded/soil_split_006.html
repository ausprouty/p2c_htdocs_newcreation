	<p class="poem">It wasn't long, however, until the younger son</p>
	<p class="poem">got everything he owned together,</p>
	<p class="poem">and left for a far country.</p>
	<p class="poem">There he squandered his money</p>
	<p class="poem">in a dissolute life of fisq (sinfulness)</p>
	<p class="poem">and moral depravity.</p>
	<p class="poem">And when he had spent his entire inheritance,</p>
	<p class="poem">and had not one thing left to remind him of his wonderful father,</p>
	<p class="poem">there arose a terrible famine in that land;</p>
	<p class="poem">and the younger son began to feel his loss.</p>
	<p class="poem">So he hired himself out to a harbi <a class="note" id="R2" href="soil_split_015.html#N2">2</a></p>
	<p class="poem">who put him on his farm to feed the pigs.</p>
	<p class="poem">The younger son would willingly have filled his belly</p>
	<p class="poem">with the husks the pigs were eating</p>
	<p class="poem">but he was treated worse than the swine,</p>
	<p class="poem">for no one offered him even pigs' food to eat.</p>
