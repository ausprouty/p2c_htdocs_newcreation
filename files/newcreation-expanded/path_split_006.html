<h2 class="subtitle" id="calibre_pb_5">THE MAN OF GOD DECIDES TO TEACH ISHA AND AHMAD ABOUT MARRIAGE IN TERMS OF THE KINGDOM</h2>
	<p class="poem">"Blessed be He in whose hands is the Kingdom......" <a id="R15" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N15">15</a></p>
	<p class="poem">And blessed indeed are the hands of Him</p>
	<p class="poem">into whom all the power of the Kingdom</p>
	<p class="poem">is given: the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> .</p>
	<p class="poem">Yet the Kingdom of God</p>
	<p class="poem">is not in word,</p>
	<p class="poem">but in power</p>
	<p class="poem">--not the words of dying men,</p>
	<p class="poem">nor the might of fleeting worldly power.</p>
	<p class="poem">Did not the living Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  himself declare,</p>
	<p class="poem">"My Kingdom is not of this world;</p>
	<p class="poem">if my Kingdom were of this world,</p>
	<p class="poem">then would my servants fight jihad." <a id="R16" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N16">16</a></p>
	<p class="poem">The Kingdom of God is in the power of His Word.</p>
	<p class="poem">And what does His Word say?</p>
	<p class="poem">The whole story swept through the mind of the man of God...</p>
	<p class="poem"><span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  HAS ACTED MIGHTILY TO BRING US TO HIS KINGDOM</p>
	<p class="poem">From the good beginning</p>
	<p class="poem">mankind has swerved</p>
	<p class="poem">from the straight path</p>
	<p class="poem">of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  and his Word.</p>
	<p class="poem">From the first commandment</p>
	<p class="poem">given beneath the tree</p>
	<p class="poem">of the knowledge of good and evil</p>
	<p class="poem">mankind has acted shadily</p>
	<p class="poem">toward <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  and his Glory.</p>
	<p class="poem">And what is the Glory of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">if not the Word of his Power?</p>
	<p class="poem">And what is his glorious Power</p>
	<p class="poem">if not the Word of his Presence?</p>
	<p class="poem">One of your prophets has said rightly:</p>
	<p class="poem">"The Messiah, Isa, Jesus son of Mary,</p>
	<p class="poem">was the Messenger of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> , and his Word</p>
	<p class="poem">that he bestowed on Mary." <a id="R17" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N17">17</a></p>
	<p class="poem">But His Word that He bestowed on Mary</p>
	<p class="poem">went forth from His mouth</p>
	<p class="poem">at the creation of the world.</p>
	<p class="poem">For in the beginning</p>
	<p class="poem">was the Word</p>
	<p class="poem">and the Word was with God</p>
	<p class="poem">and the Word was God. <a id="R18" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N18">18</a></p>
	<p class="poem">The Power and the Presence was</p>
	<p class="poem">the Only Eternal Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>;</p>
	<p class="poem">and everything was made</p>
	<p class="poem">by the Word,</p>
	<p class="poem">and without the Word</p>
	<p class="poem">was nothing made.</p>
	<p class="poem">Then the Word</p>
	<p class="poem">came on the scene</p>
	<p class="poem">as a human being</p>
	<p class="poem">who is true Man</p>
	<p class="poem">on the straight path</p>
	<p class="poem">to the tree of life.</p>
	<p class="poem">And his disciples beheld his glory,</p>
	<p class="poem">glory as of the only</p>
	<p class="poem">personal and eternal Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> ,</p>
	<p class="poem">full of grace and truth. <a id="R19" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N19">19</a></p>
	<p class="poem">What blasphemer would breathe the name of Mary here</p>
	<p class="poem">as one of the "gods in derogation of God"? <a id="R20" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N20">20</a></p>
	<p class="poem">Are you so slow in understanding</p>
	<p class="poem">that you think we believe <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  got married?</p>
	<p class="poem">What blasphemy!</p>
	<p class="poem">Who could believe that <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  would take a wife?</p>
	<p class="poem">Do you think we mean that the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">is His Son in that literal sense?</p>
	<p class="poem">Not at all!</p>
	<p class="poem">Mary was nothing but a loaner of flesh! <a id="R21" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N21">21</a></p>
	<p class="poem">For <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  has neither wife nor mother nor partner</p>
	<p class="poem">nor did He ever need a human being at all</p>
	<p class="poem">to be what He has always been--one!</p>
	<p class="poem">God always existed with His Everlasting Word</p>
	<p class="poem">and His Everlasting Spirit as tawhid (one).</p>
	<p class="poem">What blasphemer would assert otherwise?</p>
	<p class="poem">Would you be so foolish as to say</p>
	<p class="poem">that <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  once existed without His Eternal and Living Word and</p>
	<p class="poem">without His Everlasting Spirit?</p>
	<p class="poem">Would you have <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  at one time mute</p>
	<p class="poem">and unable to utter a living Word?</p>
	<p class="poem">Would you have Him at one time Spiritless,</p>
	<p class="poem">without His Eternal Spirit?</p>
	<p class="poem">Such blasphemers would do to the imaginary God they worship what</p>
	<p class="poem">they would not dream of doing to themselves</p>
	<p class="poem">--namely, cut out all living utterance and life</p>
	<p class="poem">to be left with a mere speechless, lifeless being.</p>
	<p class="poem">If only these dreamers would wake up from such nonsense</p>
	<p class="poem">and shut their mouths to save their souls!</p>
	<p class="poem">Instead they pride themselves</p>
	<p class="poem">that their speechless, Spiritless deity has no'partners'!</p>
	<p class="poem">When <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  speaks His mind He speaks His Word,</p>
	<p class="poem">for His Word is the revealed mind of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> .</p>
	<p class="poem">And we can have His mind in all things</p>
	<p class="poem">if we die to our own way of thinking</p>
	<p class="poem">and come alive to His living Word.</p>
	<p class="poem">The man of God reflected on Isha and Ahmad</p>
	<p class="poem">and how they must learn</p>
	<p class="poem">to think the thoughts of the mind</p>
	<p class="poem">revealed to us in the sacred pages of the Word.</p>
	<p class="poem">For it was in His image that we were created</p>
	<p class="poem">and it is from His glory that we have fallen,</p>
	<p class="poem">having become futile in our thinking</p>
	<p class="poem">and darkened in our senseless minds.</p>
	<p class="poem">But if we are now more like brute beasts</p>
	<p class="poem">(because of the ignorance that is in us</p>
	<p class="poem">and the blindness of our hearts),</p>
	<p class="poem">it is not because He made us so.</p>
	<p class="poem">For God gave us not an animal mind</p>
	<p class="poem">but a mind like His,</p>
	<p class="poem">a rational and a creative mind</p>
	<p class="poem">capable of communion with Him in Holiness.</p>
