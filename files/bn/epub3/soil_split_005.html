	<p class="poem">There was once a hanif (one who desires true religion)</p>
	<p class="poem">who had two sons.</p>
	<p class="poem">The younger said to his father,</p>
	<p class="poem">"Father, according to the wasiya (will),</p>
	<p class="poem">let me have the fara'id (fixed share)</p>
	<p class="poem">of the mirath (inheritance)</p>
	<p class="poem">that is coming to me."</p>
	<p class="poem">And the father divided his means and his property</p>
	<p class="poem">between the younger and the elder son.</p>
	<p class="poem">Now the elder son was a devout believer who prayed</p>
	<p class="poem">regularly five times a day</p>
	<p class="poem">and had made the Hajj (Pilgrimage) as many times.</p>
	<p class="poem">No one was respected more among the townspeople</p>
	<p class="poem">for his religious devotion than this elder son.</p>
	<p class="poem">He was a man who performed his prayers</p>
	<p class="poem">in the mosque with absolute perfection</p>
	<p class="poem">and could read the Qur'an so well</p>
	<p class="poem">that he would hold the audience spellbound.</p>
