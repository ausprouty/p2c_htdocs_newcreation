<h2 class="subtitle" id="calibre_pb_13">THE HARDENED HEART WITHOUT THE NEW CREATION IS SHAMELESS</h2>
	<p class="poem">But some don't even ask the question.</p>
	<p class="poem">Some people have no sense of shame.</p>
	<p class="poem">The man of God learned this when,</p>
	<p class="poem">having helped Ahmad save his marriage,</p>
	<p class="poem">the man of God himself had marital tragedy.</p>
	<p class="poem">We will call the name of the man of God "Hosea"</p>
	<p class="poem">though he lived in modern times.</p>
	<p class="poem">This is a true story.</p>
	<p class="poem">One day the man of God stood up in the house of God</p>
	<p class="poem">to preach.</p>
	<p class="poem">But a supernatural word came to him,</p>
	<p class="poem">not from the words of a paper book <a id="R60" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N60">60</a></p>
	<p class="poem">but from the Eternal Spirit of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> .</p>
	<p class="poem">What came to him is best described as supernatural knowledge.</p>
	<p class="poem">The living Word that spoke to his heart</p>
	<p class="poem">was as urgent as a shout</p>
	<p class="poem">and as vivid as a vision.</p>
	<p class="poem">The man of God saw in this miraculous manifestation</p>
	<p class="poem">materializing before the eye of his mind</p>
	<p class="poem">his wife in a bedroom many miles away.</p>
	<p class="poem">The person he saw with her was in the act</p>
	<p class="poem">of committing adultery.</p>
	<p class="poem">The man of God stood before the congregation</p>
	<p class="poem">and he could not begin the khutba (sermon),</p>
	<p class="poem">because in his spirit he was in the bedroom</p>
	<p class="poem">horrified at the sight of this evil</p>
	<p class="poem"><span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  was showing him.</p>
	<p class="poem">(When <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  gives supernatural knowledge</p>
	<p class="poem">He never contradicts or goes beyond</p>
	<p class="poem">His infallible written Word.)</p>
	<p class="poem">The next morning the man of God</p>
	<p class="poem">wanted to make sure this vision was true</p>
	<p class="poem">and not just his own imagination.</p>
	<p class="poem">He traveled to the house</p>
	<p class="poem">and, finding no one home,</p>
	<p class="poem">was able to examine the bedroom privately.</p>
	<p class="poem">The evidence left by the careless lovers</p>
	<p class="poem">(who thought the man of God would have to be preaching</p>
	<p class="poem">at the hour of their rendezvous</p>
	<p class="poem">and therefore could not possibly catch them)</p>
	<p class="poem">showed unmistakably that the vision was from God.</p>
	<p class="poem">The man of God confronted the adulterous woman.</p>
	<p class="poem">She had no sense of shame.</p>
	<p class="poem">"Why should she?" she thought.</p>
	<p class="poem">No one had caught her in the act,</p>
	<p class="poem">and as far as the man of God was concerned,</p>
	<p class="poem">she thought his vision was probably just a lucky guess.</p>
	<p class="poem">But had not God himself caught her?</p>
	<p class="poem">Had he not used a gift of His Eternal Spirit,</p>
	<p class="poem">the gift of supernatural knowledge,</p>
	<p class="poem">to show the man of God</p>
	<p class="poem">what only three in the world</p>
	<p class="poem">--that is, the adulterous woman, her lover, and God--knew?</p>
	<p class="poem">Had not God himself caught her in the very act of adultery, a wicked</p>
	<p class="poem">act of treachery worthy of death?</p>
	<p class="poem">But the woman had no sense of guilt before God.</p>
	<p class="poem"><span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  was very far off to her, baaeed (very remote and separate)</p>
	<p class="poem">and often the thought of God left her cold,</p>
	<p class="poem">like the thought of her husband.</p>
