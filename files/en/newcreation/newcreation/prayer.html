	<h1 class = "title">THE PRAYER LIFE OF A NEW CREATION MUSLIM</h1>
	<p class="poem">We who are new creation Muslims</p>
	<p class="poem">have already tasted of the world to come,</p>
	<p class="poem">and therefore this present world hates us. <a id = "R64" class = "note" href = "#N64">64</a></p>
	<p class="poem">In our spiritual beings we have already passed</p>
	<p class="poem">from spiritual death unto spiritual life,</p>
	<p class="poem">and Shaitan (Satan)</p>
	<p class="poem">and the evil jinn (demons)</p>
	<p class="poem">and the people of this present world,</p>
	<p class="poem">because they have not experienced the new creation</p>
	<p class="poem">through the Word of <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>, who is Isa,</p>
	<p class="poem">sometimes lash out at us with hatred and persecution.</p>
	<p class="poem">The spirit that is in them</p>
	<p class="poem">hates the Spirit that is in us.</p>
	<p class="poem">But &quot;greater is He (Isa al-Masih) who is in us</p>
	<p class="poem">than he (Shaitan) who is in the world&nbsp; <a  id = "R65" class = "note" href = "#N65">65</a></p>
	<p class="poem">And <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  works all things together for good for us.</p>
	<p class="poem">Therefore, we do not grow weary in well-doing,</p>
	<p class="poem">or in praying for our enemies,</p>
	<p class="poem">or in cautiously reaching out to them in love,</p>
	<p class="poem">or in joyfully suffering for the sake of God's message</p>
	<p class="poem">of a servant's love for a needy world.</p>
	<p class="poem">We need only put on the spiritual armor of</p>
	<p class="poem">the One who is within us</p>
	<p class="poem">and we can stand victorious in prayer <a  id = "R66" class = "note" href = "#N66">66</a></p>
	<p class="poem">as more than conquerors</p>
	<p class="poem">against our spiritual enemy, Shaitan.</p>
	<p class="poem">This is spiritual jihad. <a  id = "R67" class = "note" href = "#N67">67</a></p>
	<p class="poem">We praise the Word of <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span><a  id = "R68" class = "note" href = "#N68">68</a></p>
	<p class="poem">who loved us when we were yet his enemies,</p>
	<p class="poem">and who gives us wisdom and power</p>
	<p class="poem">to show his love in countless ways,</p>
	<p class="poem">even for our enemies.</p>
	<p class="poem">PUT ON ARMOR FOR THE BATTLE</p>
	<p class="poem">In the daily Islamic prayer</p>
	<p class="poem">one finds the ejaculation:</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;I seek refuge from God</p>
	<p class="poem">from the cursed Satan.&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">Five times a day,</p>
	<p class="poem">we who are New Creation Muslims</p>
	<p class="poem">pause to put on our spiritual</p>
	<p class="poem">armor and pray in the Spirit.</p>
	<p class="poem">Since we have &quot;no lasting city&quot; <a  id = "R69" class = "note" href = "#N69">69</a></p>
	<p class="poem">in this old creation&nbsp; world of sin and death,</p>
	<p class="poem">the real direction of our prayer</p>
	<p class="poem">is not toward anything in this visible world</p>
	<p class="poem">but toward God,</p>
	<p class="poem">who has triumphed over principalities and powers.</p>
	<p class="poem">We tear down strongholds of Shaitan</p>
	<p class="poem">and war in the Eternal Spirit</p>
	<p class="poem">in the ministry of intercession,</p>
	<p class="poem">pointing our prayers toward Isa and toward those in Mecca&nbsp; as we</p>
	<p class="poem">pray that in Him they may find the True Way.</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa al-Masih, the Word of <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> , is the true light</p>
	<p class="poem">of true submitters to the straight path.</p>
	<p class="poem">Who has <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  appointed but his Word</p>
	<p class="poem">to be the world-ruler of the new world, the new creation?</p>
	<p class="poem">And there is no other name under heaven</p>
	<p class="poem">that has been given among men</p>
	<p class="poem">by which we must be saved</p>
	<p class="poem">from the coming wrath <a  id = "R70" class = "note" href = "#N70">70</a></p>
	<p class="poem">A discipline which does not earn merit with <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">but may be an effective means of identifying with Muslims<a  id = "R71" class = "note" href = "#N71">71</a> is</p>
	<p class="poem">to put on the protection of our spiritual armor</p>
	<p class="poem">in all five daily prayers:</p>
	<p class="poem">Subh or the morning prayer,</p>
	<p class="poem">Zuhr or the noon prayer <a  id = "R72" class = "note" href = "#N72">72</a></p>
	<p class="poem">'Asr or the afternoon prayer,</p>
	<p class="poem">Maghrib or the evening prayer,</p>
	<p class="poem">and 'Ishaa or the night prayer,</p>
	<p class="poem">We pray without ceasing <a  id = "R73" class = "note" href = "#N73">73</a></p>
	<p class="poem">and we do not, in any case, make of prayer a good deed</p>
	<p class="poem">calculated to earn God's favor.</p>
	<p class="poem">We pray to <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> <span lang="AR-SA" >  </span>as though He wereour gracious Father.</p>
	<p class="poem">We pray so freely to Him not to win His favor</p>
	<p class="poem">but because we have His favor,</p>
	<p class="poem">not by our good works but by faith in His good works</p>
	<p class="poem">--that He alone has the power to make the wicked righteous</p>
	<p class="poem">and He alone has turned us from wickedness</p>
	<p class="poem">to righteousness,</p>
	<p class="poem">not by our dead religious works but by the works</p>
	<p class="poem">of Himself and His Eternal Word and His Eternal Spirit</p>
	<p class="poem">who has made of our old being a New Creation.</p>
	<p class="poem">THE WUDU (CEREMONIAL WASHING)</p>
	<p class="poem">In the Muslim manner we wash before we pray <a  id = "R74" class = "note" href = "#N74">74</a></p>

	<h2 class="subtitle">A KHUTBAH (SERMON) </h2>
	<p>&quot;GOD'S PLAN FOR THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND ISHMAEL&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.</p>
	<p class="poem">Praised be God. Praised be the God who has shown us the way, the</p>
	<p class="poem">straight path through His Word.</p>
	<p class="poem">I bear witness that there is nothing worthy of worship</p>
	<p class="poem">but God.</p>
	<p class="poem">I bear witness that Isa is the Word of God.</p>
	<p class="poem">Fear God, O you people,</p>
	<p class="poem">fear that day,</p>
	<p class="poem">the Day of Judgment,</p>
	<p class="poem">when a father will not be able to answer for his son,</p>
	<p class="poem">nor the son for his father,</p>
	<p class="poem">when an Imam will not be able to answer for a Muslim,</p>
	<p class="poem">nor a Rabbi for a Jew.</p>
	<p class="poem">O you people who have believed,</p>
	<p class="poem">turn you to God,</p>
	<p class="poem">as Ibrahim did turn to God.</p>
	<p class="poem">Truly God is One and forgives all sin through His Word.</p>
	<p class="poem">Truly we know His Word.</p>
	<p class="poem">I bear witness that Isa is His Word of forgiveness.</p>
	<p class="poem">Through Him <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  is merciful,</p>
	<p class="poem">the forgiver of sins.</p>
	<p class="poem">Through Him <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  is the most munificent,</p>
	<p class="poem">and bountiful, the King,</p>
	<p class="poem">the Holy One, the Most Merciful.&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">(The preacher or khatib or muzakkir then descends from the</p>
	<p class="poem">pulpit, and sitting on the floor of the place of prayer, offers</p>
	<p class="poem">up a silent prayer. He then again ascends the minbar or pulpit,</p>
	<p class="poem">which may be nothing more than a small three step riser in</p>
	<p class="poem">smaller mosques and proceeds.)</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.</p>
	<p class="poem">Praise be to God.&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">He who has the living Word of God for His guide</p>
	<p class="poem">is never lost.</p>
	<p class="poem">If we have truly died with His Word</p>
	<p class="poem">and have truly been brought to live again by His Word,</p>
	<p class="poem">then we truly passed from death to life.</p>
	<p class="poem">There is a text in the Quran that refers to this:</p>
	<p class="poem">'Or (take) the similitude</p>
	<p class="poem">of one who passed</p>
	<p class="poem">by a hamlet, all in ruins,</p>
	<p class="poem">to its roofs. He said:</p>
	<p class="poem">'Oh! how shall <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">bring it (ever) to life,</p>
	<p class="poem">after (this) its death?'</p>
	<p class="poem">Then in that same text (Cow 2:259)</p>
	<p class="poem">it says:</p>
	<p class="poem">'Look further at the bones,</p>
	<p class="poem">how We bring them together,</p>
	<p class="poem">and clothe them with flesh!'</p>
	<p class="poem">Many commentators believe this text</p>
	<p class="poem">is referring to Ezekiel 37:1-1O,</p>
	<p class="poem">which says,</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;The hand of the Lord was upon me (Ezekiel),</p>
	<p class="poem">and carried me out in the Spirit of the Lord,</p>
	<p class="poem">and set me down in the midst of the valley</p>
	<p class="poem">which was full of bones,</p>
	<p class="poem">and caused me to pass by them round about:</p>
	<p class="poem">and, behold, there were very many in the open valley;</p>
	<p class="poem">and, lo, they were very dry.</p>
	<p class="poem">And he (God) said to me,</p>
	<p class="poem">'Son of man, can these bones live?'</p>
	<p class="poem">And I answered,</p>
	<p class="poem">'O Lord God, thou knowest.'</p>
	<p class="poem">Again he said unto me,</p>
	<p class="poem">Prophesy upon these bones,</p>
	<p class="poem">and say unto them,</p>
	<p class="poem">O you dry bones,</p>
	<p class="poem">hear the word of the Lord.</p>
	<p class="poem">Thus saith the Lord God unto these bones;</p>
	<p class="poem">Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you,</p>
	<p class="poem">and you shall live:</p>
	<p class="poem">And I will lay sinews upon you,</p>
	<p class="poem">and will bring up flesh upon you,</p>
	<p class="poem">and cover you with skin,</p>
	<p class="poem">and put breath in you,</p>
	<p class="poem">and you shall live;</p>
	<p class="poem">and you shall know that I am the Lord.'</p>
	<p class="poem">So I (Ezekiel) prophesied as I was commanded:</p>
	<p class="poem">and as I prophesied,</p>
	<p class="poem">there was a noise,</p>
	<p class="poem">and behold a shaking,</p>
	<p class="poem">and the bones came together,</p>
	<p class="poem">bone to his bone.</p>
	<p class="poem">And when I beheld, lo,</p>
	<p class="poem">the sinews and the flesh came up upon them,</p>
	<p class="poem">and the skin covered them above:</p>
	<p class="poem">but there was no breath in them.</p>
	<p class="poem">Then said he unto me,</p>
	<p class="poem">'Prophesy unto the wind,</p>
	<p class="poem">prophesy, son of man,</p>
	<p class="poem">and say to the wind,</p>
	<p class="poem">Thus saith the Lord God;</p>
	<p class="poem">Come from the four winds, O breath,</p>
	<p class="poem">and breathe upon these slain, that</p>
	<p class="poem">they may live.'</p>
	<p class="poem">So I prophesied as he (God) commanded me,</p>
	<p class="poem">and the breath came into them,</p>
	<p class="poem">and they lived,</p>
	<p class="poem">and stood up upon their feet,</p>
	<p class="poem">an exceeding great army.&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">What is this passage talking about?</p>
	<p class="poem">Is there somewhere a great army</p>
	<p class="poem">of those who were once dead</p>
	<p class="poem">but are now being brought to life again?</p>
	<p class="poem">Are we who are New Creation Muslims included or excluded</p>
	<p class="poem">from that prophesied army?</p>
	<p class="poem">We Muslims are always asking questions like this.</p>
	<p class="poem">We always wonder if God is including us.</p>
	<p class="poem">The most pressing problem we Muslims have</p>
	<p class="poem">is our spiritual identity.</p>
	<p class="poem">The solution to that identity problem</p>
	<p class="poem">has been given to us in the ancient past</p>
	<p class="poem">through Ibrahim and Ishmael.</p>
	<p class="poem">But many anti-Muslim teachers and preachers</p>
	<p class="poem">use the Bible to teach political interpretations</p>
	<p class="poem">about the promise of the land to Ibrahim</p>
	<p class="poem">and negative interpretations about Ishmael.</p>
	<p class="poem">So many Muslims ask,</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;Why is it asserted that <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  loves the Jews</p>
	<p class="poem">as his chosen people more than he loves us Muslims?</p>
	<p class="poem">Why do so many want to twist the Scriptures</p>
	<p class="poem">to make us feel rejected?&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">But if we begin with the Taurat,</p>
	<p class="poem">B'raisheet (Genesis) chapter 15,</p>
	<p class="poem">we return to the cornerstone of our faith</p>
	<p class="poem">as new creation submitters to <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">and that cornerstone is Ibrahim.</p>
	<p class="poem">It says, &quot;Ibrahim believed God,&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">and consequently it says that it was credited to him</p>
	<p class="poem">that he became a righteous submitter to the true path.</p>
	<h2 class="subtitle">THE GOD OF ISHMAEL BE PRAISED</h2>
	<p class="poem">In Genesis chapter 16:10</p>
	<p class="poem">we see that God had a special plan for Ishmael</p>
	<p class="poem">and his descendants.</p>
	<p class="poem">In the Scriptures,</p>
	<p class="poem">the Angel of the Lord appears only</p>
	<p class="poem">when God has a special plan;</p>
	<p class="poem">and in 16:10 Ishmael's mother, Hagar,</p>
	<p class="poem">is told by the angel of the Lord,</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;I will so increase your descendants</p>
	<p class="poem">that they will be too numerous to count.&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">The original language of 16:12 is often mistranslated.</p>
	<p class="poem">The actual words are &quot;PEH-REH AH-DAM,&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">with the idea of a man that will live in the wild.</p>
	<p class="poem">The last part of 16:12</p>
	<p class="poem">says that Ishmael will live</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;in hostility toward all his brothers.&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">The reference to Ishmael (the father of the Arab peoples)</p>
	<p class="poem">and to his hostility &quot;toward all his brothers&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">(referring to Isaac, the father of Israel)</p>
	<p class="poem">is a prophecy very much fulfilled today in the Middle East.</p>
	<p class="poem">In Genesis 21 God acts to save Ishmael</p>
	<p class="poem">and his mother,</p>
	<p class="poem">just as God is saving many Muslims today.</p>
	<p class="poem">21:19 says &quot;Then God opened her (Hagar's) eyes</p>
	<p class="poem">and she saw a well of water.&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">Today God is opening the eyes of many of Ishmael's descendents</p>
	<p class="poem">and they are coming to the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  who said,</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;If any man thirst,</p>
	<p class="poem">let him come to me and drink.&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">Unfortunately, the sons</p>
	<p class="poem">of those feuding brothers Ishamel and Isaac</p>
	<p class="poem">have forgotten that their fathers wept together</p>
	<p class="poem">when they buried their father Ibrahim,</p>
	<p class="poem">as it says,</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre&quot; (Genesis 25:9).</p>
	<p class="poem">In Isaiah 42:10-12</p>
	<p class="poem">we see another prophecy,</p>
	<p class="poem">that the sons of Ishmael (Kedar--see Genesis 25:13)</p>
	<p class="poem">will come back to God and will</p>
	<p class="poem">&quot;proclaim his praise in the islands.&quot;</p>
	<p class="poem">We believe this refers to the messianic Islamic du'at,</p>
	<p class="poem">those new creation muslim emissaries</p>
	<p class="poem">who will be sent out to make the call,</p>
	<p class="poem">the invitation to submit to <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">and His Word Isa our Deliverer ('Asim).</p>
	<p class="poem">Again, look at Isaiah 60:7:</p>

Testament, we know that the homes of the faithful are  acceptable 
to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">

   as places of prayer--see Acts 2:42,46. Friday is 
important to us because on Friday Isa, performed the  great act 
that has become the foundation for the forgiveness of our  sins: 
on Friday nearly two thousand years ago Isa shed his  blood to 
cover and make expiation or kaffarah for our corrupt and  fallen 
human nature.&nbsp; Since it is this noon prayer that is  used at the 
Friday services, the Zuhr prayer is given in this section  in its 
entirety.&nbsp; &quot;One person thinks that some days  are holier than

Hebrews 10:22 &quot;with our bodies washed with pure  water&quot; to remind 
us that we are clean before God only as we are submerged  into the

traditional and preferred method.&nbsp; It is not the  purpose of this 
section to yoke believers to any system of formalism or  ritualism 
or to detract from a simple, direct prayer life, as Isa  taught. 
Our purpose is to learn to pray in such an Islamic way  that 
Muslims will believe that &quot;we have become all things  to all men 
that we might by all means save some.&quot; Moreover, we  do believe in 
demons and that we wrestle against them as  believers.&nbsp; We know 
that we overcome the ruler of all demons, Shaitan, by the  blood 
of Isa--Revelation 12:11.&nbsp; As we apply the water, by  faith we 
cover ourselves with the blood of Isa, the One &quot;that  came by 
water and blood, even Isa al-Masih; not by water only,  but by 
water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth  witness,

</p><p id = "N78" class = "note"><span class="note_number">78</span> This is the call to prayer given by the Muaadhdhin,  who is 
traditionally an adult male and who stands to make the 
announcement that brings everyone to form a line behind  him on 
prayer rugs or sajajid. Each believer has already been  praying 
and meditating on Scripture before the service begins and  no one 
is talking or looking around.&nbsp; The room is  reverently prepared 
for the prayer service by the prayerful concentration of  all the 
people.&nbsp; Each believer should by faith see the armor  of 
Ephesians chapter 6 in front of him on his prayer carpet as the  objects he 
will use to mark off an area of space or sutra within  which he is 
not disturbed by human or demoniacal influences. <a class = "return" href = "#R78"> (&nbsp;Return&nbsp;) </a>

leader, though in larger mosques, an official is  specially 
appointed for the purpose.&nbsp; In smaller mosques  lacking a minaret 
the call may be made from the side of the building or  from the 
door or from inside.&nbsp; In any event, a messianic 
Muaadhdhin, focusing his intercessory heart toward the  lost 
millions facing Mecca, stands with his face turned in  their

recites the messianic formula given here. <a class = "return" href = "#R79"> (&nbsp;Return&nbsp;) </a>

begin the service.&nbsp; The Imam may come up at any  moment after the 
first Adhaan; As he approaches the three-step riser  Minbar or 
pulpit, he faces the worshippers and greets them with  &quot;As-Salaamu 
'Alaikum&quot;or &quot;Peace be on you.&quot;&nbsp; The  Imam then sits down facing 
the believers. The Imam gives two messages, one brief and  one 
longer with a free time of worship between them.&nbsp;  The sermon or 
Khutbah begins with the formula, Al hamdu lillaah  (&quot;All praise is 
due to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">

  &quot;) and may occasionally and selectively use the 
Qur'an as a bridge to illustrate the canonical truth of  the 
authoritative prophetic message given exclusively in the Holy  Scriptures, 
provided the leader roots the believers in Scripture  alone and 
does not let them drift away from memorizing and  meditating 
on the only infallible guide for faith and  practice.&nbsp; At the 
conclusion of the sermon, the Imam leads the worshipers  in the 
congregational prayers.&nbsp; It should be noted: all  five of the 
daily prayers have a similar structure and use the same  basic 
prayer postures of standing, bowing, sitting,  prostrating, 
lifting hands, etc.&nbsp; Since the noon prayer is the  one also used 
at the weekly congregational meeting, it is offered here  as an 
example of individual five-times daily devotional prayers  useable 
by messianic Muslims in a contextualized ministry. <a class = "return" href = "#R88"> (&nbsp;Return&nbsp;) </a>

pronounced by the Muaadhdhin, who may be the same person  as the

begin.&nbsp; At this point we stand for prayer and  consciously make

Isa the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">

issues of life.'--see Proverbs 4:23.&nbsp; If you  &quot;believe in your 
heart that God raised him--Isa--from the dead, you shall  be 
saved.&nbsp; For with the heart man believes unto righteousness&quot;-see 
Romans 10:9-10.&nbsp; Meditating on this verse, we  realize that the 
World-Judge is alive to judge all men, and that if we  believe 
this with our heart, &quot;every man that hath this hope  in Him

Then the risen and victorious Word of <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">

   spoke through the 
Apostolic author of Ephesians that we must put on the  armor of 
God &quot;always&quot; see Ephesians 6:18--in order to  stand our ground 
against the Devil so that we may stand blameless before  the Son 
of Man--see Luke 21:36. Therefore, five times a day is  not any 
too frequent for submitters to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">

could leave this world and see the lake of fire where the 
unbelievers in Isa will be thrown, you would not return  the same 
person.&nbsp; The wickedness of this world would not have  the same 
power over you, because part of you would still be on the  other 
side gazing at the awesome lake of fire.&nbsp; You would  be dead to 
sin and you would not need all kinds of religious rules  to remind 
you to be holy.&nbsp; Realizing that there are only two  alternatives 
in life, either to be baptized into the eternal torment  of the 
lake of fire or to be baptized by faith into the death of  Isa, 
you would come back a believer led by the Eternal Spirit  and you 
would henceforth deal with this wicked world like a dead  man,

   is greatest.&quot;&nbsp; Still standing, the 
believer bends forward from the torso and, with the hands 
supporting the weight of his upper body at the knees, he  remains 
standing in this bowing position as he recites the  prayers. 
However, with his hands on his knees, he is aware of the  belt of 
truth, which holds the sword of the Spirit, the Word of  God, the 
only measuring standard of authoritative prophecy and  inerrant 
words &quot;that are able to make you wise unto salvation  through 
faith which is in Isa al-Masih.'--see II Timothy 3:15. As  the 
believer feels the blood rushing to his head, he  remembers the 
helmet of salvation which brings &quot;every thought  captive to obey 
al-Masih.&quot;-see 11 Corinthians 10:5.&nbsp; We look  neither to the left
