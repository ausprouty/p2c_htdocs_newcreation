<h2 class="subtitle" id="calibre_pb_2">THE GOD OF ISHMAEL BE PRAISED</h2>
	<p class="poem">In Genesis chapter 16:10</p>
	<p class="poem">we see that God had a special plan for Ishmael</p>
	<p class="poem">and his descendants.</p>
	<p class="poem">In the Scriptures,</p>
	<p class="poem">the Angel of the Lord appears only</p>
	<p class="poem">when God has a special plan;</p>
	<p class="poem">and in 16:10 Ishmael's mother, Hagar,</p>
	<p class="poem">is told by the angel of the Lord,</p>
	<p class="poem">"I will so increase your descendants</p>
	<p class="poem">that they will be too numerous to count."</p>
	<p class="poem">The original language of 16:12 is often mistranslated.</p>
	<p class="poem">The actual words are "PEH-REH AH-DAM,"</p>
	<p class="poem">with the idea of a man that will live in the wild.</p>
	<p class="poem">The last part of 16:12</p>
	<p class="poem">says that Ishmael will live</p>
	<p class="poem">"in hostility toward all his brothers."</p>
	<p class="poem">The reference to Ishmael (the father of the Arab peoples)</p>
	<p class="poem">and to his hostility "toward all his brothers"</p>
	<p class="poem">(referring to Isaac, the father of Israel)</p>
	<p class="poem">is a prophecy very much fulfilled today in the Middle East.</p>
	<p class="poem">In Genesis 21 God acts to save Ishmael</p>
	<p class="poem">and his mother,</p>
	<p class="poem">just as God is saving many Muslims today.</p>
	<p class="poem">21:19 says "Then God opened her (Hagar's) eyes</p>
	<p class="poem">and she saw a well of water."</p>
	<p class="poem">Today God is opening the eyes of many of Ishmael's descendents</p>
	<p class="poem">and they are coming to the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  who said,</p>
	<p class="poem">"If any man thirst,</p>
	<p class="poem">let him come to me and drink."</p>
	<p class="poem">Unfortunately, the sons</p>
	<p class="poem">of those feuding brothers Ishamel and Isaac</p>
	<p class="poem">have forgotten that their fathers wept together</p>
	<p class="poem">when they buried their father Ibrahim,</p>
	<p class="poem">as it says,</p>
	<p class="poem">"in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre" (Genesis 25:9).</p>
	<p class="poem">In Isaiah 42:10-12</p>
	<p class="poem">we see another prophecy,</p>
	<p class="poem">that the sons of Ishmael (Kedar--see Genesis 25:13)</p>
	<p class="poem">will come back to God and will</p>
	<p class="poem">"proclaim his praise in the islands."</p>
	<p class="poem">We believe this refers to the messianic Islamic du'at,</p>
	<p class="poem">those new creation muslim emissaries</p>
	<p class="poem">who will be sent out to make the call,</p>
	<p class="poem">the invitation to submit to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">and His Word Isa our Deliverer ('Asim).</p>
	<p class="poem">Again, look at Isaiah 60:7:</p>
	<p class="poem">"All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered</p>
	<p class="poem">together unto thee,</p>
	<p class="poem">the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee:</p>
	<p class="poem">they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar,</p>
	<p class="poem">and I will glorify the house of my glory."</p>
	<p class="poem">How much clearer can God make it</p>
	<p class="poem">that a revival is coming among the Muslims?</p>
	<p class="poem">In Acts 2:9-11 we see much of the modern Muslim world</p>
	<p class="poem">represented when the Injil was first proclaimed</p>
	<p class="poem">at al-Quds (Jerusalem);</p>
	<p class="poem">notice the text lists "the Arabs,"</p>
	<p class="poem">it lists "Mesopotamia" (Syria and Iraq),</p>
	<p class="poem">"Libya," "Parthians and Medians"</p>
	<p class="poem">(part of Kuwait and the Kurdish)</p>
	<p class="poem">--all sons of Ishmael who are among those</p>
	<p class="poem">that will come in the last days</p>
	<p class="poem">as new creations to glorify God.</p>
	<p class="poem">God has a plan of salvation for them</p>
	<p class="poem">and wants them to be saved</p>
	<p class="poem">from his own holy hostility against unholiness</p>
	<p class="poem">just as he wants Jew and non-Jew to be saved</p>
	<p class="poem">from the murderous hostility that is between them.</p>
