<h2 class="subtitle" id="calibre_pb_7">THE MAN OF GOD THINKS ABOUT HOW TO SAVE ISHA'S MARRIAGE</h2>
	<p class="poem">The man of God thought about Isha</p>
	<p class="poem">and how she must learn to understand God's forgiveness.</p>
	<p class="poem">It is not that we love God and serve him with such grace</p>
	<p class="poem">that we can be assured of forgiveness</p>
	<p class="poem">based on what we have done for God.</p>
	<p class="poem">No, it is that God loves us and has served us  with such grace</p>
	<p class="poem">that the Judge of sin has taken the whole weight</p>
	<p class="poem">of our guilt and condemnation upon Himself.</p>
	<p class="poem">The Word of the eternal Judgment of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> became also</p>
	<p class="poem">the Word of His eternal Mercy!</p>
	<p class="poem">But how?</p>
	<p class="poem">In the person of His Word, Isa al-Masih.</p>
	<p class="poem">Thus it is that we can be assured of forgiveness,</p>
	<p class="poem">based on what God has done for us</p>
	<p class="poem">in giving us a new mind with His Word,</p>
	<p class="poem">and a tender conscience with His Eternal Spirit.</p>
	<p class="poem"><span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  has always reflected upon Himself with His wisdom,</p>
	<p class="poem">and His wisdom is His Word. <a id="R22" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N22">22</a></p>
	<p class="poem">Isa al-Masih Himself is that Word!</p>
	<p class="poem">He is the everlasting Word</p>
	<p class="poem">whose words will stand forever. <a id="R23" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N23">23</a></p>
	<p class="poem">The Kitab (Book) of Isa is Genesis to Revelation,</p>
	<p class="poem">infallibly accurate in its teaching about him,</p>
	<p class="poem">and Isa is the hidden source and subject of each sura (chapter)</p>
	<p class="poem">for those who can read with the eyes of the Eternal Spirit.</p>
	<p class="poem">As a word reveals the hidden mind of a father,</p>
	<p class="poem">so <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  intended this mind to be in us</p>
	<p class="poem">that was also in his Word. <a id="R24" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N24">24</a></p>
	<p class="poem">But the mirror of our reflection of His holiness</p>
	<p class="poem">has been shattered,</p>
	<p class="poem">and the whole human race has distorted itself</p>
	<p class="poem">in mocking pride and rebellion</p>
	<p class="poem">against the humble and obedient Word.</p>
	<p class="poem">As a sin-fallen race</p>
	<p class="poem">we still possess a vestige of the mirror of conscience.</p>
	<p class="poem">Like a looking-glass before the mind,</p>
	<p class="poem">the conscience tells the human race</p>
	<p class="poem">how good we might have been</p>
	<p class="poem">had Man not warped himself</p>
	<p class="poem">in the refractive beams of Man's proud self-love.</p>
	<p class="poem">Therefore, we are without excuse when we reject</p>
	<p class="poem">any measure of truth we receive.</p>
	<p class="poem">Our sin-prone race is like someone</p>
	<p class="poem">who once was commanded to peer</p>
	<p class="poem">at his Ideal in a full-length mirror</p>
	<p class="poem">and then disobediently walked away</p>
	<p class="poem">and forgot what he looked like.</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  is that Ideal.</p>
	<p class="poem">And the fatherly heart of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">out of whom the Word spoke in the beginning</p>
	<p class="poem">has been stirred to speak again</p>
	<p class="poem">to the lost family of Adam:</p>
	<p class="poem">"I reared sons, I brought them up,</p>
	<p class="poem">but they have rebelled against me."</p>
	<p class="poem">For the Word became</p>
	<p class="poem">the One who was to come,</p>
	<p class="poem">the heavenly Son of Man,</p>
	<p class="poem">the Bar Nasha (Aramaic for Son of Man). <a id="R25" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N25">25</a></p>
	<p class="poem">The prophet Daniel saw him</p>
	<p class="poem">in the clouds of glory and wrote:</p>
	<p class="poem">"After this I saw in the night visions</p>
	<p class="poem">and, behold, one like the Son of Man</p>
	<p class="poem">came with the clouds of heaven...</p>
	<p class="poem">and he was given ... a kingdom...</p>
	<p class="poem">that all people, nations, and languages</p>
	<p class="poem">should serve him as deity (Daniel 7:13)." <a id="R26" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N26">26</a></p>
	<p class="poem">The Word that was in the beginning with God,</p>
	<p class="poem">the Word who was the Wisdom God possessed prior to His works of old (Proverbs 8:22)</p>
	<p class="poem">His Wisdom, God's Son (Proverbs 30:4),</p>
	<p class="poem">His Messiah Bar Enosh who came to the Atik Yomin and Maryam,</p>
	<p class="poem">the very Word whom New Creation Muslims submit to</p>
	<p class="poem">and look for (Daniel 7:13; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41),</p>
	<p class="poem">the Word that was God,</p>
	<p class="poem">this same Word was made flesh</p>
	<p class="poem">and dwelt among us,</p>
	<p class="poem">telling his disciples,</p>
	<p class="poem">"Verily, verily, I say unto you,</p>
	<p class="poem">Hereafter you shall see heaven open</p>
	<p class="poem">and the angels of God</p>
	<p class="poem">ascending and descending upon the Bar Enosh Son of Man.,,<a id="R27" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N27">27</a></p>
	<p class="poem">For the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  had come</p>
	<p class="poem">to speak into a new existence our dying humanity.</p>
	<p class="poem">And just as Man had gone down to death</p>
	<p class="poem">in the Garden of Eden</p>
	<p class="poem">as one conquered by Satan and sin,</p>
	<p class="poem">so now Man may ascend again to life from the empty Garden tomb</p>
	<p class="poem">through One who overcame for us,</p>
	<p class="poem">through One who conquered as our imam (leader),</p>
	<p class="poem">our representative,</p>
	<p class="poem">our exemplar,</p>
	<p class="poem">-a human being who is that</p>
	<p class="poem">and yet more than human,</p>
	<p class="poem">served as deity (Daniel 7:13),</p>
	<p class="poem">the eternal personal Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> ,</p>
	<p class="poem">God the Word from God the Almighty,</p>
	<p class="poem">Light from Light,</p>
	<p class="poem">Very God from Very God.</p>
	<p class="poem">Since this is true</p>
	<p class="poem">-that the Word who is</p>
	<p class="poem"> and was</p>
	<p class="poem"> and is to come,</p>
	<p class="poem">the Word who is</p>
	<p class="poem"> the express thought of God,</p>
	<p class="poem"> the perfect image of God,</p>
	<p class="poem"> the creative voice of God</p>
	<p class="poem">-since this very Word</p>
	<p class="poem">descended so that He might dwell</p>
	<p class="poem">in our hearts by faith</p>
	<p class="poem">and make us like Him,</p>
	<p class="poem">restoring us in the image of His Father</p>
	<p class="poem">that we might call on His Father as sons,</p>
	<p class="poem">that we might ascend with Him,</p>
	<p class="poem">passing beyond the angels</p>
	<p class="poem">(Do you not know that we shall judge angels?)</p>
	<p class="poem">-since this is true,</p>
	<p class="poem">should it not teach us that,</p>
	<p class="poem">denying ungodliness and worldly lusts,</p>
	<p class="poem">we should live sober,</p>
	<p class="poem">righteous, and godly lives</p>
	<p class="poem">in this present world?</p>
	<p class="poem">Since the Word Himself revealed to us</p>
	<p class="poem">perfect surrender to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  and</p>
	<p class="poem">total submission to His will,</p>
	<p class="poem">only through Him and His iman (faith),</p>
	<p class="poem">once for all delivered to the holy ones,</p>
	<p class="poem">do we know what is possible to man</p>
	<p class="poem">in the path of obedience to the one true God.</p>
	<p class="poem">Thus the man of God reflected on the straight path</p>
	<p class="poem">and on Isha and Ahmad and</p>
	<p class="poem">on their battle against Shaitan.</p>
