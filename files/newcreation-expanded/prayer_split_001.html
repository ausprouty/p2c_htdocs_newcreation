<h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0">THE PRAYER LIFE OF A NEW CREATION MUSLIM</h1>
	<p class="poem">We who are new creation Muslims</p>
	<p class="poem">have already tasted of the world to come,</p>
	<p class="poem">and therefore this present world hates us. <a id="R64" class="note" href="prayer_split_006.html#N64">64</a></p>
	<p class="poem">In our spiritual beings we have already passed</p>
	<p class="poem">from spiritual death unto spiritual life,</p>
	<p class="poem">and Shaitan (Satan)</p>
	<p class="poem">and the evil jinn (demons)</p>
	<p class="poem">and the people of this present world,</p>
	<p class="poem">because they have not experienced the new creation</p>
	<p class="poem">through the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>, who is Isa,</p>
	<p class="poem">sometimes lash out at us with hatred and persecution.</p>
	<p class="poem">The spirit that is in them</p>
	<p class="poem">hates the Spirit that is in us.</p>
	<p class="poem">But "greater is He (Isa al-Masih) who is in us</p>
	<p class="poem">than he (Shaitan) who is in the world  <a id="R65" class="note" href="prayer_split_006.html#N65">65</a></p>
	<p class="poem">And <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  works all things together for good for us.</p>
	<p class="poem">Therefore, we do not grow weary in well-doing,</p>
	<p class="poem">or in praying for our enemies,</p>
	<p class="poem">or in cautiously reaching out to them in love,</p>
	<p class="poem">or in joyfully suffering for the sake of God's message</p>
	<p class="poem">of a servant's love for a needy world.</p>
	<p class="poem">We need only put on the spiritual armor of</p>
	<p class="poem">the One who is within us</p>
	<p class="poem">and we can stand victorious in prayer <a id="R66" class="note" href="prayer_split_006.html#N66">66</a></p>
	<p class="poem">as more than conquerors</p>
	<p class="poem">against our spiritual enemy, Shaitan.</p>
	<p class="poem">This is spiritual jihad. <a id="R67" class="note" href="prayer_split_006.html#N67">67</a></p>
	<p class="poem">We praise the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span><a id="R68" class="note" href="prayer_split_006.html#N68">68</a></p>
	<p class="poem">who loved us when we were yet his enemies,</p>
	<p class="poem">and who gives us wisdom and power</p>
	<p class="poem">to show his love in countless ways,</p>
	<p class="poem">even for our enemies.</p>
	<p class="poem">PUT ON ARMOR FOR THE BATTLE</p>
	<p class="poem">In the daily Islamic prayer</p>
	<p class="poem">one finds the ejaculation:</p>
	<p class="poem">"I seek refuge from God</p>
	<p class="poem">from the cursed Satan."</p>
	<p class="poem">Five times a day,</p>
	<p class="poem">we who are New Creation Muslims</p>
	<p class="poem">pause to put on our spiritual</p>
	<p class="poem">armor and pray in the Spirit.</p>
	<p class="poem">Since we have "no lasting city" <a id="R69" class="note" href="prayer_split_006.html#N69">69</a></p>
	<p class="poem">in this old creation  world of sin and death,</p>
	<p class="poem">the real direction of our prayer</p>
	<p class="poem">is not toward anything in this visible world</p>
	<p class="poem">but toward God,</p>
	<p class="poem">who has triumphed over principalities and powers.</p>
	<p class="poem">We tear down strongholds of Shaitan</p>
	<p class="poem">and war in the Eternal Spirit</p>
	<p class="poem">in the ministry of intercession,</p>
	<p class="poem">pointing our prayers toward Isa and toward those in Mecca  as we</p>
	<p class="poem">pray that in Him they may find the True Way.</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa al-Masih, the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> , is the true light</p>
	<p class="poem">of true submitters to the straight path.</p>
	<p class="poem">Who has <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  appointed but his Word</p>
	<p class="poem">to be the world-ruler of the new world, the new creation?</p>
	<p class="poem">And there is no other name under heaven</p>
	<p class="poem">that has been given among men</p>
	<p class="poem">by which we must be saved</p>
	<p class="poem">from the coming wrath <a id="R70" class="note" href="prayer_split_006.html#N70">70</a></p>
	<p class="poem">A discipline which does not earn merit with <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">but may be an effective means of identifying with Muslims<a id="R71" class="note" href="prayer_split_006.html#N71">71</a> is</p>
	<p class="poem">to put on the protection of our spiritual armor</p>
	<p class="poem">in all five daily prayers:</p>
	<p class="poem">Subh or the morning prayer,</p>
	<p class="poem">Zuhr or the noon prayer <a id="R72" class="note" href="prayer_split_006.html#N72">72</a></p>
	<p class="poem">'Asr or the afternoon prayer,</p>
	<p class="poem">Maghrib or the evening prayer,</p>
	<p class="poem">and 'Ishaa or the night prayer,</p>
	<p class="poem">We pray without ceasing <a id="R73" class="note" href="prayer_split_006.html#N73">73</a></p>
	<p class="poem">and we do not, in any case, make of prayer a good deed</p>
	<p class="poem">calculated to earn God's favor.</p>
	<p class="poem">We pray to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> <span lang="AR-SA">  </span>as though He wereour gracious Father.</p>
	<p class="poem">We pray so freely to Him not to win His favor</p>
	<p class="poem">but because we have His favor,</p>
	<p class="poem">not by our good works but by faith in His good works</p>
	<p class="poem">--that He alone has the power to make the wicked righteous</p>
	<p class="poem">and He alone has turned us from wickedness</p>
	<p class="poem">to righteousness,</p>
	<p class="poem">not by our dead religious works but by the works</p>
	<p class="poem">of Himself and His Eternal Word and His Eternal Spirit</p>
	<p class="poem">who has made of our old being a New Creation.</p>
	<p class="poem">THE WUDU (CEREMONIAL WASHING)</p>
	<p class="poem">In the Muslim manner we wash before we pray <a id="R74" class="note" href="prayer_split_006.html#N74">74</a></p>

	<p class="poem">so that I can see only those things you want me to see.</p>
	<p class="poem">I wash my ears</p>
