<h2 class="subtitle" id="calibre_pb_11">A WORD ABOUT JUDAS AND THOSE LIKE HIM</h2>
	<p class="poem">How can anyone read what is godly</p>
	<p class="poem">if he himself is devilish?</p>
	<p class="poem">Could Judas "read" Jesus?</p>
	<p class="poem">Even though Judas sat next to the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">eating his bread at the Last Supper,</p>
	<p class="poem">all Judas could read were "errors."</p>
	<p class="poem">Judas had frequently heard Jesus say</p>
	<p class="poem">that it was necessary for the Messiah to die</p>
	<p class="poem">as a sacrifice for the sins of the world,</p>
	<p class="poem">but Judas "read" this solemn declaration as an error.</p>
	<p class="poem">"The Messiah must be strong to rule us,"</p>
	<p class="poem">Judas thought, "not weak."</p>
	<p class="poem">"How can he be anybody important</p>
	<p class="poem">if he's going to die instead of lead an army?</p>
	<p class="poem">His errors will get us all killed, not just himself!"</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa had enough love to die for Judas' sins</p>
	<p class="poem">but, like the rest of unregenerate humanity,</p>
	<p class="poem">Judas saw error in this and in everything else</p>
	<p class="poem">except in his own black heart.</p>
	<p class="poem">Bitter sons of the devil!</p>
	<p class="poem">Black-hearted traitors against God</p>
	<p class="poem">who take sides with Judas</p>
	<p class="poem">against the infallibly accurate Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> !</p>
	<p class="poem">But some fools are even more perverse!</p>
	<p class="poem">Who is more truly a liar</p>
	<p class="poem">than the one who would make this devil Judas</p>
	<p class="poem">who committed suicide in shame and utter ignominy</p>
	<p class="poem">the one who was crucified in Isa's place? <a id="R47" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N47">47</a></p>
	<p class="poem">Such a one will surely go the way of Judas</p>
	<p class="poem">for agreeing with him</p>
	<p class="poem">that God's account of things cannot be trusted.</p>
	<p class="poem">Only a good man like Isa could cry out</p>
	<p class="poem">while hanging on the khashabah (wood) in the agony of death,</p>
	<p class="poem">"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"</p>
	<p class="poem">A traitor like Judas would know the answer to that question!</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa said of Judas, "It would have been better</p>
	<p class="poem">if that man had never been born."</p>
	<p class="poem">And if like Judas we think ourselves wiser</p>
	<p class="poem">than the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> ,</p>
	<p class="poem">it would have been better</p>
	<p class="poem">if such an error as us had never been born!</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa was willing to die that same day for Judas</p>
	<p class="poem">but Judas refused to pick up his cross and die,</p>
	<p class="poem">if necessary, with Isa.</p>
	<p class="poem">Judas saw an error in that.</p>
	<p class="poem">What craftiness this fool had!</p>
	<p class="poem">He saw he could save his own life</p>
	<p class="poem">and even make some money</p>
	<p class="poem">just by betraying Isa</p>
	<p class="poem">to the wicked priestly rulers who were looking to kill him. But</p>
	<p class="poem">whoever tries to save his life will lose it <a id="R48" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N48">48</a></p>
	<p class="poem">Only those who lose their lives in "Islam"("Surrender") to Isa</p>
	<p class="poem">will find their lives and keep them for eternity.</p>
	<p class="poem">Judas was the first apostle to lose his life,</p>
	<p class="poem">and he also lost his soul,</p>
	<p class="poem">as it says,</p>
	<p class="poem">"Let his habitation be desolate. <a id="R49" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N49">49</a></p>
	<p class="poem">He missed seeing the Messiah's resurrection by only a few hours!</p>
	<p class="poem">But his fall was predicted</p>
	<p class="poem">by the prophet Da'ud (David) in the Zabur (Psalms)</p>
	<p class="poem">as part of the sufferings to be endured by the Messiah:</p>
	<p class="poem">"Yes, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted,</p>
	<p class="poem">which did eat of my bread,</p>
	<p class="poem">hath lifted up his heel against me."<a id="R50" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N50">50</a></p>
	<p class="poem">But the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  who delivered this prophecy to Da'ud</p>
	<p class="poem">a thousand years before it happened</p>
	<p class="poem">also knew that Judas would fulfill it.</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa al-Masih the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  said,</p>
	<p class="poem">"I assure you, one of you will betray me,</p>
	<p class="poem">one who is eating with me." <a id="R51" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N51">51</a></p>
	<p class="poem">Over 500 years before this,</p>
	<p class="poem">the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  had enabled the prophet Zechariah</p>
	<p class="poem">to foresee what God would cause to happen:</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa would be betrayed for thirty pieces of silver; <a id="R52" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N52">52</a></p>
	<p class="poem">which actually happened</p>
	<p class="poem">when the priests paid Judas that amount of money</p>
	<p class="poem">to purchase unwittingly</p>
	<p class="poem">the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world.</p>
	<p class="poem">"I am going to strike the shepherd</p>
	<p class="poem">and the sheep will be scattered," Zechariah predicted.</p>
	<p class="poem">The Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>  had even inspired</p>
	<p class="poem">the prophet Daniel to foresee</p>
	<p class="poem">not only the death of the Messiah</p>
	<p class="poem">but also the subsequent destruction of the Temple:</p>
	<p class="poem">"After this period of 434 years, the Messiah will be killed, but</p>
	<p class="poem">not for himself, and the people of the prince that shall come</p>
	<p class="poem">shall destroy the city and the sanctuary." <a id="R53" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N53">53</a></p>
	<p class="poem">The manner of the Messiah 's atoning death</p>
	<p class="poem">which will not be "for himself" <a id="R54" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N54">54</a></p>
	<p class="poem">but for the sins of the whole world</p>
	<p class="poem">is clearly described in the Zabur (Psalms):</p>
	<p class="poem">"They pierced my hands and feet." <a id="R55" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N55">55</a></p>
	<p class="poem">But Judas had no taste for the word of God.</p>
	<p class="poem">He did not treasure these words in his heart.</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa warned that man cannot live by bread alone</p>
	<p class="poem">but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.</p>
	<p class="poem">Yet Judas thought he could mock the grace of the Lord</p>
	<p class="poem">and lie to the Eternal Spirit of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> .</p>
	<p class="poem">Judas fooled only himself.</p>
	<p class="poem">The Word of God could read the traitor's inmost thoughts.</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa didn't need anyone to tell him what was in a man.</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa knew what Judas would do.</p>
	<p class="poem">He allowed him to do it</p>
	<p class="poem">so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled.</p>
	<p class="poem">But woe to the man who fulfilled them!</p>
	<p class="poem">Judas didn't run far.</p>
	<p class="poem">When all his treachery was over,</p>
	<p class="poem">he found himself totally alone</p>
	<p class="poem">and only Satan wanted his detestable company.</p>
	<p class="poem">So Judas committed suicide.</p>
	<p class="poem">Now he is in hell.</p>
	<p class="poem">How do we know?</p>
	<p class="poem">Because Isa said it would have been better</p>
	<p class="poem">if he had never been born.</p>
	<p class="poem">Never having been born</p>
	<p class="poem">would be like annihilation in hell;</p>
	<p class="poem">but there is no annihilation in hell,</p>
	<p class="poem">only conscious eternal anguish,</p>
	<p class="poem">as it says, "And these shall go way</p>
	<p class="poem">into everlasting punishment.." <a id="R56" class="note" href="path_split_019.html#N56">56</a></p>
	<p class="poem">Isa himself warned about the eternal reality of hell</p>
	<p class="poem">more solemnly and emphatically than anyone.</p>
	<p class="poem">Therefore, if you want to think like Judas</p>
	<p class="poem">and harbor treacherous thoughts that the Word of God is error</p>
	<p class="poem">and harden your heart's gratitude</p>
	<p class="poem">against Isa's sacrifice for you to save you from hell,</p>
	<p class="poem">then there definitely will be room in hell for you with Judas.</p>
	<p class="poem">But it would be better for you if you had never been born.</p>
	<p class="poem">The moral judgment of God will require</p>
	<p class="poem">that every living rebel</p>
	<p class="poem">will be abandoned forever in the conscious state of his rebellion</p>
	<p class="poem">as eternal just retribution.</p>
	<p class="poem">Who could be a bigger fool</p>
	<p class="poem">than the one who scoffs</p>
	<p class="poem">at the sacrificial love of the Word of God</p>
	<p class="poem">who died and rose</p>
	<p class="poem">to speak eternal life into our hearts</p>
	<p class="poem">and to breathe on us the Eternal Spirit?</p>
	<p class="poem">This state could have been avoided</p>
	<p class="poem">had he judged himself and repented of this wickedness,</p>
	<p class="poem">believing that the Word who is the Judge from <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">came to die to take the penalty for our crimes.</p>
	<p class="poem">Who is more worthy of judgment</p>
	<p class="poem">than the one who rejects the Judge's merciful act</p>
	<p class="poem">of taking, though himself innocent,</p>
	<p class="poem">the culprit's penalty of judgment on himself?</p>
	<p class="poem">Who is more worthy of judgment</p>
	<p class="poem">than the one who would have the Judge</p>
	<p class="poem">thus suffer and die in vain?</p>
	<p class="poem">Who is more worthy of judgment</p>
	<p class="poem">than the one who would go on, his life unchanged,</p>
	<p class="poem">wickedly refusing to believe</p>
	<p class="poem">even after he had heard</p>
	<p class="poem">of this merciful and loving Judge from <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> ?</p>
	<p class="poem">Who could be a bigger fool than the one who,</p>
	<p class="poem">being on the side of men and not God,</p>
	<p class="poem">sells his own soul to eternal torment</p>
	<p class="poem">for a few fleeting rags in this life?</p>
	<p class="poem">Judas was an apostle!</p>
	<p class="poem">He was among those selected for the privilege</p>
	<p class="poem">of governing the Kingdom of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
	<p class="poem">at the side of the Messiah Himself!</p>
	<p class="poem">But an upright man can in fact give up</p>
	<p class="poem">his privileged status before God</p>
	<p class="poem">and can choose to enjoy for a time the pleasure</p>
	<p class="poem">of not listening to the true Isa,</p>
	<p class="poem">of not sharing in the sufferings</p>
	<p class="poem">that arise because of Isa's words.</p>
	<p class="poem">(The true Jesus is that one who bled</p>
	<p class="poem">and died for sin and rose again!).</p>
	<p class="poem">Any Judas can choose to avoid the trouble that comes</p>
	<p class="poem">because of the Word of His blood</p>
	<p class="poem">and of His Judgment</p>
	<p class="poem">and of His giving of the Spirit.</p>
	<p class="poem">Any privileged man can betray his own integrity</p>
	<p class="poem">and can copy a devil like Judas.</p>
	<p class="poem">Who does this more truly</p>
	<p class="poem">than the one who has no respect for God's law</p>
	<p class="poem">and says the Book is now a corrupt pile of errors</p>
	<p class="poem">and not to be trusted or taken seriously?</p>
	<p class="poem">Is God's Book in error?</p>
	<p class="poem">Is it not rather you who are in error,</p>
	<p class="poem">you who know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God?</p>
	<p class="poem">Will you judge the Word in error</p>
	<p class="poem">or will the Word of God judge you in error?</p>
	<p class="poem">Which will it be?</p>
	<p class="poem">The folly of your judgment of the Word?</p>
	<p class="poem">Or the judgment of the Word on your folly?</p>
	<p class="poem">Oh the horror of this betrayal of the Word of God!</p>
	<p class="poem">The horror of hell is that God allows us</p>
	<p class="poem">to attain what our wicked hearts demand:</p>
	<p class="poem">the lie of al-Dajjal (Anti-Christ) which we love</p>
	<p class="poem">rather than the truth of Messiah</p>
	<p class="poem">which we love</p>
	<p class="poem">to call error.</p>
	<p class="poem">Judas wanted it this way</p>
	<p class="poem">and the horror is that God allowed him his way.</p>
	<p class="poem">Only God can take this treachery out of our minds;</p>
	<p class="poem">it was there from the time that the first human being</p>
	<p class="poem">rebelled against the holy commandment.</p>
	<p class="poem">That spiritual treachery is still there today</p>
	<p class="poem">when the Word of God is read by skeptical rebels.</p>
	<p class="poem">Only the Lord can remove this treachery from our hearts.</p>
	<p class="poem">The Lord did this for Peter,</p>
	<p class="poem">an apostle who also denied the Lord</p>
	<p class="poem">and also refused to die with him.</p>
	<p class="poem">The Lord removed Peter's treacherous unspiritual nature</p>
	<p class="poem">and gave him a new spirit,</p>
	<p class="poem">so that he would never deny the Lord again</p>
	<p class="poem">but would take up his cross</p>
	<p class="poem">and even be willing to die for the Lord.</p>
	<p class="poem">Only the Lord can remove this treachery</p>
	<p class="poem">and He does it when we turn to him.</p>
	<p class="poem">But if we refuse, note well:</p>
	<p class="poem">fury grips the Lord when He sees</p>
	<p class="poem">the wicked treacherously abandoning His Word.</p>
	<p class="poem">Do you want to call His Word error and make him angry?</p>
	<p class="poem">Are you stronger than the Lord?</p>
	<p class="poem">Some declare they have light</p>
	<p class="poem">but it is in fact a false knower's light,</p>
	<p class="poem">like the light in the ancient heresies.</p>
	<p class="poem">And if the light within you is darkness,</p>
	<p class="poem">how great is that darkness!</p>
	<p class="poem">These "knowers" in their wicked pride</p>
	<p class="poem">go beyond what is written</p>
	<p class="poem">and boast of "knowledge" higher than</p>
	<p class="poem">the faith once for all delivered to the holy ones.</p>
	<p class="poem">With brazen tongues and dead-looking eyes</p>
	<p class="poem">these self-willed souls</p>
	<p class="poem">refuse the knowledge that could bring them life.</p>
	<p class="poem">Their arrogance knows no bounds;</p>
	<p class="poem">like a raging wind that swirls and casts up dirt</p>
	<p class="poem">wherever it flies,</p>
	<p class="poem">so their minds rush</p>
	<p class="poem">to call error the Word</p>
	<p class="poem">and the Word error.</p>
	<p class="poem">(Who are you to interpret the true Word,</p>
	<p class="poem">you without true faith from the Eternal Spirit of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>?)</p>
