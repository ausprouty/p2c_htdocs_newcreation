	<p class="poem">The truth comes like seed from a farmer's hand.</p>
	<p class="poem">The ears that hear the truth</p>
	<p class="poem">are like different kinds of soil</p>
	<p class="poem">receiving the farmer's seed.</p>
	<p class="poem">Ears without understanding hear the truth</p>
	<p class="poem">but Shaitan (Satan) comes</p>
	<p class="poem">like the birds along the path</p>
	<p class="poem">and carries the truth away</p>
	<p class="poem">as soon as it is planted in the hearer's heart.</p>
	<p class="poem">Ears with fickle attention hear the truth</p>
	<p class="poem">and welcome it at first with joy;</p>
	<p class="poem">but such a hearer has no unwavering root in himself</p>
	<p class="poem">and he does not last;</p>
	<p class="poem">when a crisis or a persecution comes</p>
	<p class="poem">on account of the truth,</p>
	<p class="poem">such a hearer falls away at once.</p>
	<p class="poem">Ears with divided desires hear the word,</p>
	<p class="poem">but the worries of this world,</p>
	<p class="poem">and the lure of riches,</p>
	<p class="poem">and the pleasures of life,</p>
	<p class="poem">are like thorns that choke the truth</p>
	<p class="poem">which produces in such a hearer absolutely nothing.</p>
	<p class="poem">However, ears with understanding hear the word</p>
	<p class="poem">like rich soil receiving seed.</p>
	<p class="poem">Such a hearer yields a great harvest,</p>
	<p class="poem">since a hundred or sixty or thirty times</p>
	<p class="poem">as many hearers may receive the truth through him.</p>
	<p class="poem">He who has ears to hear the truth</p>
	<p class="poem">of the following mathal (parable), let him hear!</p>
