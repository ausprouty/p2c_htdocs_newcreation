	<p class="poem">"<span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> , the merciful and forgiving One,</p>
	<p class="poem">I confess and agree with your Word</p>
	<p class="poem">that I have had a sinful will</p>
	<p class="poem">and have sinned</p>
	<p class="poem">and need a new will.</p>
	<p class="poem">I believe the Word of God who is Isa,</p>
	<p class="poem">is the very expression of your will and can make me pure</p>
	<p class="poem">as, by the power of your Eternal Spirit,</p>
	<p class="poem">I am enabled to be like him.</p>
	<p class="poem">May I never forget the great cost of his blood</p>
	<p class="poem">to effect the atoning sacrifice</p>
	<p class="poem">that takes away the penalty for my sins.</p>
	<p class="poem">I call on you now and every day</p>
	<p class="poem">to deliver me from my sins,</p>
	<p class="poem">which offend you and have caused</p>
	<p class="poem">the separation between us.</p>
	<p class="poem">Come into my heart and life,</p>
	<p class="poem">Isa, the risen Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> ,</p>
	<p class="poem">and fill me with your love</p>
	<p class="poem">that I might submit to</p>
	<p class="poem">and follow your commandments</p>
	<p class="poem">sent down through you</p>
	<p class="poem">in the Taurat and the Injil</p>
	<p class="poem">by the inspiration of the Eternal Spirit.</p>
	<p class="poem">Lead me on the straight path to the new creation.</p>
	<p class="poem">On the basis of what Isa al-Masih has done,</p>
	<p class="poem">I offer this request to you, praise be unto you,</p>
	<p class="poem">and believe in my heart that through Isa your Word</p>
	<p class="poem">it is granted. Amen."</p>
