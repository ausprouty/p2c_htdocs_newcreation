<h2 class="subtitle" id="calibre_pb_1">THE ETERNAL WORD OF <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
</h2>
<p class="poem">The Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   always existed</p>
<p class="poem">as the Servant (abd) of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  .</p>
<p class="poem">Before the Word took human form as Isa the Messiah</p>
<p class="poem">he was still personally existent,</p>
<p class="poem">and reflected the likeness of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
</p>
<p class="poem">as the heavenly Word of Judgment</p>
<p class="poem">whose personal name was Son of Man.<a class="note" href="notes.html#N210">210</a></p>
<p class="poem">He is the pre-existent Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  ,</p>
<p class="poem">his uncreated and co-eternal agent</p>
<p class="poem">in creation and redemption and judgment.</p>
<p class="poem">More than the living heavenly pattern</p>
<p class="poem">about whom the Eternal Spirit</p>
<p class="poem">inspired the true Kitab (Book) of Taurat and Injil,</p>
<p class="poem">Isa is also both the death-conquering Messenger of the  covenant</p>
<p class="poem">and the life-giving Message of the covenant.<a class="note" href="notes.html#N211">211</a></p>
<p class="poem">He is, in fact, the covenant.</p>
<p class="poem">The Dead Sea Scrolls incorruptibly preserve</p>
<p class="poem">the prediction of the prophet Isaiah who,</p>
<p class="poem">seven hundred years before Isa the Messiah arrived,</p>
<p class="poem">spoke of him as the covenant:</p>
<p class="poem">"Behold my Servant, whom I uphold;</p>
<p class="poem">my chosen one in whom I myself delight.</p>
<p class="poem">I have put my Spirit upon him:</p>
<p class="poem">He shall bring forth judgment to the Nations</p>
<p class="poem">the islands shall wait for his law (or teaching)</p>
<p class="poem">.....I the Lord have called thee (the Servant of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  )</p>
<p class="poem">in righteousness</p>
<p class="poem">and will hold thine hand,</p>
<p class="poem">and will keep thee for a covenant of the people,</p>
<p class="poem">for a light to the Gentiles."<a class="note" href="notes.html#N212">212</a></p>
<p class="poem">You have heard of the saying,</p>
<p class="poem">"We have already, beforehand,</p>
<p class="poem">taken the covenant ('ahida) of Adam,</p>
<p class="poem">but he forgot: and we found</p>
<p class="poem">on his part no firm resolve." <a class="note" href="notes.html#N213">213</a></p>
<p class="poem">Only the indwelling Word who is the covenant</p>
<p class="poem">can put his own eternal "firm resolve" in us,</p>
<p class="poem">for he is the promised indwelling law</p>
<p class="poem">to be written indelibly on the heart.<a class="note" href="notes.html#N214">214</a></p>
<p class="poem">As the prophet Malachi says,</p>
<p class="poem">the Messiah would be called,</p>
<p class="poem">"The Messenger of the Covenant" and the  "Lord"<a class="note" href="notes.html#N215">215</a></p>
<p class="poem">You have heard this saying:</p>
<p class="poem">"When Jesus came</p>
<p class="poem">with clear signs, he said:</p>
<p class="poem">'...Fear <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   and obey me."'<a class="note" href="notes.html#N216">216</a></p>
<p class="poem">The "clear signs" Jesus came with</p>
<p class="poem">were the miracles he used to attest the eternal covenant</p>
<p class="poem">he would institute as the Lamb of God.</p>
<p class="poem">On that night, the night of the climax of his pilgrimage,</p>
<p class="poem">he took the bread and the cup</p>
<p class="poem">and he said that these were now the memorials</p>
<p class="poem">for remembrance of his body and his blood</p>
<p class="poem">of the New and Eternal Covenant of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  .</p>
<p class="poem">"Remember we took</p>
<p class="poem">a Covenant (mithaq) from the Children</p>
<p class="poem">of Israel..." <a class="note" href="notes.html#N217">217</a></p>
<p class="poem">This covenant was celebrated each year</p>
<p class="poem">in the Passover meal,</p>
<p class="poem">where remembrance was made of how <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
</p>
<p class="poem">saved them at the Red Sea</p>
<p class="poem">and gave them the law on Mount Sinai.</p>
<p class="poem">It was at such a feast (id) of pilgrimage (hajj)</p>
<p class="poem">that Isa instituted a meal of remembrance</p>
<p class="poem">in which he would be the Lamb of God,</p>
<p class="poem">and his blood would effect a new exodus from sin,</p>
<p class="poem">a new hijrah (emigration) from sin and death</p>
<p class="poem">for all true new creation submitters to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  .</p>
<p class="poem">Those who deny this truth have these two sayings</p>
<p class="poem">of their own to refute them:</p>
<p class="poem">"Isa al-Masih (Jesus the Messiah)</p>
<p class="poem">was the Messenger of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   and his Word."<a class="note" href="notes.html#N218">218</a></p>
<p class="poem">"And they (the children of Israel) said:</p>
<p class="poem">'<span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   took our promise not to believe</p>
<p class="poem">in a Messenger unless He showed us a  sacrifice"'<a class="note" href="notes.html#N219">219</a></p>
                    <p class="poem">The common people did believe in great numbers</p>
<p class="poem">in the sacrifice that Isa showed them,</p>
<p class="poem">but the proud and self-comfortable religious leaders</p>
<p class="poem">did not believe and they led the people away from the  truth.</p>
<p class="poem">So it is today.</p>
<p class="poem">Isa himself said,</p>
<p class="poem">"If the blind lead the blind,</p>
<p class="poem">both will fall into a pit."</p>
                    <p class="poem">But we who are Khalq Jadeed (New Creation) Muslims</p>
<p class="poem">do in fact submit to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
</p>
<p class="poem">by obeying him,</p>
<p class="poem">by embarking on a pilgrimage of witness</p>
<p class="poem">through the New Creation Wudu of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
</p>
<p class="poem">to the New Creation Id ul-'Adha.</p>
<p class="poem">Just as Musa passed through death</p>
<p class="poem">at the Red Sea,</p>
<p class="poem">so we pass through the death of our old life</p>
<p class="poem">at the death ghusl of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  .</p>
<p class="poem">Just as the dead body of a Muslim</p>
<p class="poem">receives a total ablution (ghusl),</p>
<p class="poem">so by faith we put to death our body of sinful  disposition when</p>
<p class="poem">we take the ghusl of sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   (immersion).</p>
<p class="poem">Just as those with Musa</p>
<p class="poem">ate a sacrificial meal</p>
<p class="poem">to remember their sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   at the Red Sea,</p>
<p class="poem">so we who are messianic Muslims</p>
<p class="poem">eat a sacrificial meal</p>
<p class="poem">to remember our sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   at the command of Isa al-Masih.</p>
<p class="poem">You must know that a ghusl (total ablution)</p>
<p class="poem">was necessary for a dead body being buried,</p>
<p class="poem">and that it was also in order</p>
<p class="poem">before the 'Id prayers.</p>
                    <p class="poem">As with Moses and the Passover Seder Table,</p>
<p class="poem">so with Isa and the Lord's Table</p>
<p class="poem">--no one could be admitted to the Table</p>
<p class="poem">where the covenant was remembered</p>
<p class="poem">unless the covenant had been properly initiated.</p>
<p class="poem">Isa commanded that the sign of covenant initiation</p>
<p class="poem">be the death ghusl of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  ,</p>
<p class="poem">the wudu of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  .</p>
                    <p class="poem">Do you understand that you should</p>
<p class="poem">submit to sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   before taking</p>
<p class="poem">the New Creation Id ul-'Adha</p>
<p class="poem">with the other believers?</p>
                    <p class="poem">This water probe is designed by God</p>
<p class="poem">to be an overt sign of your submission to his authority.</p>
<p class="poem">God has commanded us in his infallibly accurate Word</p>
<p class="poem">not only to confess Isa</p>
<p class="poem">as <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
<span dir="ltr">
</span>
<span dir="ltr">
</span>
's Word of authority</p>
<p class="poem">and our Lord</p>
<p class="poem">in our private and congregational prayers;</p>
<p class="poem">God has also commanded us to confess him</p>
<p class="poem">in the sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   and the 'Id ul-Adha of Isa.</p>
<p class="poem">Now the question is,</p>
<p class="poem">will you submit to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   and truly obey Isa from your heart?</p>
<p class="poem">An immersion was before the Passover supper</p>
<p class="poem">and before the Last Supper of Isa</p>
<p class="poem">when he finished his pilgrimage</p>
<p class="poem">and offered himself as the eternal 'Id ul-Adha,</p>
<p class="poem">the Feast of Sacrifice,</p>
<p class="poem">the Lamb of God,</p>
<p class="poem">the bread of life that comes down from heaven.</p>
<p class="poem">Isa spoke of spiritually ingesting</p>
<p class="poem">the everlasting benefits of his sacrifice in this way:</p>
<p class="poem">"Whoso eateth my flesh,</p>
<p class="poem">and drinketh my blood,</p>
<p class="poem">hath eternal life;</p>
<p class="poem">and I will raise him up on the last day."<a class="note" href="notes.html#N220">220</a></p>
<p class="poem">We also remember that Isa said of himself,</p>
<p class="poem">Even the Messiah "came not to be served,</p>
<p class="poem">but to serve,</p>
<p class="poem">and to give his life as a ransom for many."<a class="note" href="notes.html#N221">221</a></p>
<p class="poem">In the Dead Sea Scrolls the prophet (Isaiah)</p>
<p class="poem">said the Messiah would "bear the sin of many."</p>
<p class="poem">Isa was fulfilling that prophecy</p>
<p class="poem">made 700 years before,</p>
<p class="poem">and the dhabh (sacrifice) fulfillment</p>
<p class="poem">showed Isa's self-awareness</p>
<p class="poem">of his whole life's purpose.</p>
                    <p class="poem">We who are Khalq Jadeed (New Creation) Muslims</p>
<p class="poem">do not have to make a sacrifice</p>
<p class="poem">in the Valley of Mina in the vicinity of Mecca,</p>
<p class="poem">because the object of our pilgrimage <a class="note" href="notes.html#N222">222</a></p>
<p class="poem">has already made the perfect sacrifice for us.</p>
                    <p class="poem">Pilgrims are eager in Mecca to touch or kiss the Black  Stone as</p>
<p class="poem">if it represents the right hand of God,</p>
<p class="poem">with whom they are renewing their covenant.</p>
<p class="poem">But we who are Khalq Jadeed Muslims believe this verse:</p>
<p class="poem">"Kiss the Son <a class="note" href="notes.html#N223">223</a></p>
<p class="poem">lest he be angry</p>
<p class="poem">and ye perish from the way."<a class="note" href="notes.html#N224">224</a></p>
<p class="poem">He is the chief cornerstone <a class="note" href="notes.html#N225">225</a></p>
<p class="poem">of the House of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  ,</p>
<p class="poem">(a temple not made with hands)</p>
<p class="poem">and Ibrahim rejoiced to see his day,<a class="note" href="notes.html#N226">226</a></p>
<p class="poem">for He is the right hand of God's righteousness <a class="note" href="notes.html#N227">227</a></p>
<p class="poem">and in him alone is the covenant renewed.<a class="note" href="notes.html#N228">228</a></p>
<p class="poem">When we stand up at the New Creation Id ul-Adha</p>
<p class="poem">it is not because the pilgrims stand</p>
<p class="poem">to perform the wuquf (the "standing")</p>
<p class="poem">from noon until sunset at 'Arafat.</p>
<p class="poem">We stand because whoever eats this bread and drinks this  cup</p>
<p class="poem">preaches the death of the Lord until he comes.<a class="note" href="notes.html#N229">229</a></p>
<p class="poem">Therefore, we confess Isa in prayer,</p>
<p class="poem">we confess him before true believers,</p>
<p class="poem">we confess him in the sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  ,</p>
<p class="poem">and we confess him in the Id ul-Adha.</p>
<p class="poem">The Scripture says,</p>
<p class="poem">"If you confess with your lips the Lord Isa (Jesus)</p>
<p class="poem">and believe in your heart that God raised him from the  dead</p>
<p class="poem">(he died for our sins and was buried</p>
<p class="poem">and rose again on the third day</p>
<p class="poem">according to the Scriptures),</p>
<p class="poem">you shall be saved."<a class="note" href="notes.html#N230">230</a></p>
<p class="poem">When those pilgrims stand under the scorching sun</p>
<p class="poem">on the ninth day of the final hajj month,</p>
<p class="poem">they pray and recite verses of the Qur'an,</p>
<p class="poem">hoping that their sins will be forgiven.</p>
<p class="poem">But we know our sins</p>
<p class="poem">are already forgiven in Isa's name,</p>
<p class="poem">in the name of Jesus,</p>
<p class="poem">and a day is coming when all those who reject Isa</p>
<p class="poem">will stand before the scorching heat of the Word of God.</p>
<p class="poem">When we take Isa's cup,</p>
<p class="poem">then we also remember that Isa said,</p>
<p class="poem">"Whoever is thirsty,</p>
<p class="poem">let him come to me and drink.</p>
<p class="poem">.....whoever drinks of the water</p>
<p class="poem">that I shall give him</p>
<p class="poem">shall never thirst;</p>
<p class="poem">but the water that I shall give him</p>
<p class="poem">shall be in him a well of water</p>
<p class="poem">springing up into everlasting life."<a class="note" href="notes.html#N231">231</a></p>
<p class="poem">The Kaaba has a door,</p>
<p class="poem">and the shrine itself</p>
<p class="poem">is called the House of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  .</p>
<p class="poem">But Isa said, "I am the door,"</p>
<p class="poem">and we know that no one enters</p>
<p class="poem">the Spiritual House of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>

<p class="poem">"We all, with open face,</p>
<p class="poem">beholding as in a glass</p>
<p class="poem">the glory of the Lord,</p>
<p class="poem">are changed into the same image</p>
<p class="poem">from glory to glory,</p>
<p class="poem">even as by the Spirit of the Lord.<a class="note" href="notes.html#N232">232</a></p>
<p class="poem">"Beloved, now are we the sons of God</p>

<p class="poem">The Jews who were baptized were not using the ceremony</p>
<p class="poem">to indicate that they had changed their religion</p>
<p class="poem">from their old religion to a new one.</p>
<p class="poem">The ceremony was first used to indicate</p>
<p class="poem">a renewal movement within the one religion</p>

<p class="poem">The ceremony of sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
</p>
<p class="poem">represents a conversion from sin,</p>
<p class="poem">not from one religion to another.</p>
<p class="poem">It is a rite of passage from the old life to the new  life, not</p>
<p class="poem">from the old religion to the new religion.</p>
<p class="poem">New creation Muslims are still Muslims (submitters to  God).<a class="note" href="notes.html#N239">239</a>.</p>
<p class="poem">They are more fully in submission ("islam") to  Him.<a class="note" href="notes.html#N240">240</a></p>
<p class="poem">If certain religionists want to use a water ritual</p>
<p class="poem">as a rite of passage from one religion to another,</p>
<p class="poem">then let them go ahead and do it.</p>
<p class="poem">But let no one confuse what they are doing</p>
<p class="poem">(having people</p>
<p class="poem">radically change their religious labels and their Muslim  names</p>
<p class="poem">on their identity card,</p>
<p class="poem">expecting people to alienate themselves from</p>
<p class="poem">their culture, etc.) with what we are doing.</p>
                    <p class="poem">The Sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   is not the cleansing of the body,</p>
<p class="poem">nor does the water magically remove the demonic</p>
<p class="poem">or cleanse sin (I Peter 3:21).</p>
                    <p class="poem">This is a humanly contrived teaching which ignorant men</p>
<p class="poem">have tried to add to God's Word.</p>
<p class="poem">In this misunderstanding, Muslim religionists can be as  guilty as</p>
<p class="poem">Christian religionists.</p>
<p class="poem">For example, nowhere does the Qur'an teach that the wudu</p>
<p class="poem">(washing prior to the five-times-daily prayers)</p>
<p class="poem">cleanses from sin.</p>
<p class="poem">Some believe that when a believer</p>
<p class="poem">washes his face, hands and feet,</p>
<p class="poem">every sin connected with these parts of the body</p>
<p class="poem">will come out as a result of ablution.</p>
<p class="poem">But we know that only the infinitely precious blood</p>
<p class="poem">of the Masih's sacrifice</p>
<p class="poem">can wash away sins,</p>
<p class="poem">and our faith is in his blood alone.</p>
<p class="poem">The fallacy of believing in the cleansing power of mere  water is</p>

<p class="poem">when we stand before Him to be judged by his Everlasting  Word.</p>
                    <p class="poem">It is important to remember</p>
<p class="poem">that according to the Bible, an ordinance</p>
<p class="poem">is a symbolic rite instituted by Isa al-Masih.</p>
<p class="poem">There are two: immersion in the proper name of God</p>
<p class="poem">and a communion meal in remembrance of Isa.</p>
<p class="poem">One ordinance signifies the initiation of the covenant,</p>
<p class="poem">and the other renews it.</p>
<p class="poem">Of the two ordinances,</p>
<p class="poem">the first communion meal was celebrated in secrecy.</p>
<p class="poem">Why? Because of enemies and spies,</p>
<p class="poem">one of whom (Judas) managed to intrude into the rite,</p>
<p class="poem">though he was a false brother and a devil,</p>
<p class="poem">but it was necessary that prophecy be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="poem">Therefore, whoever says that an ordinance</p>
<p class="poem">can not be secret and private in times of danger</p>
<p class="poem">does not know much about the New Testament.</p>
                    <p class="poem">At the time of danger after the persecution</p>
<p class="poem">following the martyrdom of Stephen,</p>
<p class="poem">who witnessed the sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   of the Ethiopian eunuch</p>
<p class="poem">but Philip who administered the ordinance as its only  witness?</p>
<p class="poem">Martyrdom is not to be encouraged.</p>
<p class="poem">Isa instructed his disciples to be wise as serpents</p>
<p class="poem">but as harmless as doves</p>
<p class="poem">and not to cast pearls before dangerous people</p>
<p class="poem">who would turn and try to tear them</p>
<p class="poem">with such precious personal information. <a class="note" href="notes.html#N250">250</a></p>
<p class="poem">My ethical problem is whether I will obey the Lord</p>
<p class="poem">and take sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  .</p>
<p class="poem">The ritual itself need not even be discussed with someone</p>
<p class="poem">who translates it as an "act of a traitor."</p>
<p class="poem">The holy things of the Lord are not for outsiders.</p>
<p class="poem">Such a person needs to understand and yield to salvation</p>
<p class="poem">before he is ready to hear about sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  ,</p>
<p class="poem">which comes after and not before salvation.</p>
                    <p class="poem">Jesus cast no pearls before Pilate, Herod, or Caiaphas,</p>
<p class="poem">and these swine were amazed at his silence.</p>
<p class="poem">But he knew what was in a man,</p>
<p class="poem">whether his heart was open or whether he was dangerous,</p>
<p class="poem">and he needed no one to tell him what was in a person.</p>
<p class="poem">So it is with our sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  .</p>
<p class="poem">We who are the leaders in the messianic Muslim movement</p>
<p class="poem">do not invite Judas-type witnesses to our sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">

<p class="poem">who will return with the police to destroy the flock.</p>
                    <p class="poem">We keep the wrong people away</p>
<p class="poem">and we have a security screening system</p>
<p class="poem">such as we see Jesus using in John 12:2Off.</p>
<p class="poem">Only sympathetic and trustworthy believers</p>
<p class="poem">who have been carefully studied and examined</p>
<p class="poem">by those gifted with the ability to discern spirits</p>
<p class="poem">can take part in the Id ul-Adha sevice.</p>
                    <p class="poem">You should discuss this privately</p>
<p class="poem">with the leader of your fellowship</p>
<p class="poem">and trust the Lord that he will protect you.</p>
<p class="poem">Pray and ask the Lord for discernment</p>
<p class="poem">and he will show you who is trustworthy.</p>
<p class="poem">In the beginning,</p>
<p class="poem">new believers are sometimes</p>
<p class="poem">either fearful of everyone (paranoid)</p>
<p class="poem">or overly trusting of everyone (naive)</p>
<p class="poem">The Lord will show you how to avoid either</p>
<p class="poem">of these extremes</p>
<p class="poem">and to have his wisdom;</p>
<p class="poem">if you ask believing, He will answer.<a class="note" href="notes.html#N251">251</a></p>
<p class="poem">We do not have to tell everyone</p>

<p class="poem">just the ones you want to know.</p>
<p class="poem">The leader who administers it, if he is a godly man,</p>
<p class="poem">is the only witness you need have.</p>
<p class="poem">However, remember that the ordinance ceremonially</p>
<p class="poem">initiates you into the body of Messiah,</p>

<p class="poem">Imagine if you will</p>
<p class="poem">a few Muslims with their imam.</p>

<p class="poem">and is their spiritual guide (murshid)</p>
<p class="poem">to keep them</p>
<p class="poem">on the straight path (sirat mustaqim).</p>
<p class="poem">The imam is the elder (sheikh)</p>
<p class="poem">and often the overseer (muraqib) or senior elder</p>
<p class="poem">of their place of assembly (mujtama').</p>
                    <p class="poem">Now imagine these Muslims,</p>
<p class="poem">that is, the imam and the candidate (mutarabbis)</p>
<p class="poem">or aspirant for sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">

  .</p>
<p class="poem">Whether he or she is the only candidate at the ceremony</p>
<p class="poem">or there are others to take the ceremony with him or her,</p>
<p class="poem">it is the same ceremony in any case. <a class="note" href="notes.html#N252">252</a></p>
<p class="poem">They may or may not have witnesses.</p>
<p class="poem">The Imam himself is sufficient witness.</p>
<p class="poem">Certainly no one should be there who may turn out to be</p>
<p class="poem">a Judas and inform the religious authorities.</p>
<p class="poem">The ceremony may at times of danger be as private</p>
<p class="poem">as the Lord's Supper was at a similar time,</p>
<p class="poem">for on that night Isa al-Masih</p>
<p class="poem">was hidden from the eyes of all wicked men</p>
<p class="poem">with his small flock of a dozen disciples.</p>
<p class="poem">No one who could hurt them was allowed to know</p>
<p class="poem">where the ceremony took place or who the participants  were.</p>
<p class="poem">It took an inside informer, Judas,</p>
<p class="poem">to make the whereabouts of the ceremony</p>
<p class="poem">a matter of information for the enemies of Isa.</p>
                    <p class="poem">The men who were with Isa</p>
<p class="poem">appreciated his efforts to protect them.</p>
<p class="poem">However, one of these disciples (hawari), John,</p>
<p class="poem">wrote later in Revelation 21:8</p>
<p class="poem">that cowards will find themselves in the lake of fire.</p>
<p class="poem">The main reason Judas left the secret ceremony</p>
<p class="poem">and would not involve himself in it any further,</p>
<p class="poem">was because he was a coward</p>
<p class="poem">who feared that Jesus (and he) would be killed.</p>
<p class="poem">Therefore, he tried to save his life</p>
<p class="poem">by betraying Isa to the authorities.</p>
<p class="poem">"But whoever would save his life will lose it,</p>
<p class="poem">and whoever will lose his life</p>
<p class="poem">(totally entrust it to the guardian-care of Isa)</p>
<p class="poem">will save it and keep it for eternity." (Mark 8:35)</p>
                    <p class="poem">Therefore, the Muslim candidate (mutarabbis)</p>
<p class="poem">or candidates have thoroughly counted the cost</p>
<p class="poem">when they meet with their imam</p>
<p class="poem">in a secluded place for the sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">

   ceremony.</p>
<p class="poem">Romans 6:4 says we are buried with him in the sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">

  .</p>
<p class="poem">Now, everyone should know that when a Muslim is buried</p>
<p class="poem">his body is given a special burial washing.</p>
<p class="poem">This is called a ghusl.</p>
<p class="poem">In the ghusl every impurity is to be removed from the  body</p>
<p class="poem">and water is supposed to moisten</p>
<p class="poem">every part of the body and hair.</p>
<p class="poem">The ritual washing of the corpse is called ghusl,</p>
<p class="poem">and this is a very definite part of the preparation</p>
<p class="poem">of the body for interment.</p>
<p class="poem">A dead man can no longer sin.</p>
<p class="poem">His body ceases sinning and can be washed once and for  all.</p>
<p class="poem">This is the point made in Romans 6.</p>
<p class="poem">We declare our bodies dead</p>

<p class="poem">our bodies could enter into the same death</p>
<p class="poem">and cease serving Shaitan (Satan) in this wicked world.</p>
<p class="poem">Listen to the argument again in the passage:</p>
<p class="poem">"What shall we say then?</p>

<p class="poem">as were brought under submission</p>
<p class="poem">to sibghat into Isa al-Masih</p>
<p class="poem">were baptized into His death?</p>
<p class="poem">Therefore we are buried with him</p>
<p class="poem">by immersion-burial into death:</p>

<p class="poem">John the Baptist (Yahya) that day.</p>
<p class="poem">John was calling the sons of Ibrahim</p>
<p class="poem">to submit to sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   in preparation for the world Judge who</p>
<p class="poem">was coming on the scene, the Messiah.</p>
<p class="poem">Yahya the precursor (farat) of Isa</p>
<p class="poem">preached repentance to an evil and adulterous world.</p>
<p class="poem">Yahya accused everyone, even the ultra-religious,</p>
<p class="poem">of being unclean before <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  .</p>
<p class="poem">He preached a ghusl (total ritual ablution of the body)  of</p>
<p class="poem">repentance,</p>
<p class="poem">demanding that everyone surrender to <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
</p>
<p class="poem">through the sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   which he preached.</p>
<p class="poem">The self-righteous person,</p>
<p class="poem">too proud to admit he is junub in his heart</p>
<p class="poem">(guilty of major impurity)</p>
<p class="poem">would not obey the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
<span dir="ltr">
</span>
through Yahya.</p>
<p class="poem">The ultra-religious of his day,</p>
<p class="poem">the mullahs of the sect of the Pharisees,</p>
<p class="poem">would not submit to his ghusl.</p>
<p class="poem">They considered themselves secure</p>
<p class="poem">in their religious gnosis (knowledge)</p>
<p class="poem">and in the praise they got from men</p>
<p class="poem">for their religious good deeds,</p>
<p class="poem">and they were not seeking the praise</p>
<p class="poem">that comes from God alone.</p>
<p class="poem">Yahya warned the whole religious establishment of his day</p>
<p class="poem">that all such hypocritical religious snakes</p>
<p class="poem">would be thrown by the Messiah the Judge (Masih al-Hakam)</p>
<p class="poem">into the eternal fire.</p>
<p class="poem">When John saw Isa coming</p>
<p class="poem">to take the sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   from him,</p>
<p class="poem">he said that he (John) should rather be immersed by Isa,</p>
<p class="poem">John knew that even though he was a prophet, he was still</p>
<p class="poem">very much a sinner by nature,<a class="note" href="notes.html#N253">253</a></p>
<p class="poem">as is every sin-prone child of his sin-prone parents.</p>
<p class="poem">But Isa was the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   himself</p>
<p class="poem">and there is no sin in the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  .</p>
<p class="poem">However, Isa answered John this way:</p>
<p class="poem">"Allow it to be so now:</p>
<p class="poem">for thus it becometh us</p>
<p class="poem">to fulfill all righteousness."</p>
<p class="poem">Isa meant that sinners could be accounted righteous,</p>
<p class="poem">and righteousness could be made complete</p>
<p class="poem">only if the righteous Word of<span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span></p>
<p class="poem">personally suffered a death for the wicked.</p>
<p class="poem">Only then could the wicked enter into that death,</p>
<p class="poem">and, repenting, die to wickedness,</p>
<p class="poem">and come alive to true, holy life</p>
<p class="poem">through the spiritual new birth.</p>
<p class="poem">Only the righteous Word of our judgment</p>
<p class="poem">could become this substitute, this replacement ('iwadan).</p>
<p class="poem">He was the only one who is the Word of God</p>
<p class="poem">and therefore he was qualified to make compensation for  us.</p>
<p class="poem">He paid with his death the price</p>
<p class="poem">for our sins ('ada'u).</p>
<p class="poem">He gave a just and merciful exchange:</p>
<p class="poem">his sinless life given in death,</p>
<p class="poem">a death which he did not deserve,</p>
<p class="poem">was exchanged for our death-deserving sin;</p>
<p class="poem">and the gift was given to us of eternal life</p>
<p class="poem">which we do not deserve.</p>
                    <p class="poem">All of this was so clear to Isa at the time</p>
<p class="poem">of his sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  .</p>
<p class="poem">And later he explained to his disciples (hawari),</p>
<p class="poem">in a cryptic prophetic allusion to his death in al-Quds:</p>
<p class="poem">"But I have a baptism (referring to a total  immersion</p>
<p class="poem">into suffering that was coming to him shortly)</p>
<p class="poem">to be baptized with,</p>
<p class="poem">and how I am straitened (distressed)</p>
<p class="poem">till it be accomplished!"(Luke 12:50)</p>
<p class="poem">Imagine an imam and a Khalq Jadeed Muslim</p>
<p class="poem">approaching the water in a secluded place</p>
<p class="poem">such as where the Lord's Supper was celebrated.</p>
<p class="poem">Imagine the joy of the occasion</p>
<p class="poem">but also the seriousness,</p>
<p class="poem">because we cannot</p>
<p class="poem">enter into the new creation life of the Word of God</p>
<p class="poem">unless we enter into his death.</p>
<p class="poem">Imagine that the imam and the new creation Muslims</p>
<p class="poem">are wearing white</p>
<p class="poem">and that the white they are wearing represents</p>
<p class="poem">the burial shroud that was on the body</p>
<p class="poem">of the totally submitted One,</p>
<p class="poem">the Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  .</p>
<p class="poem">However, it represents also the ihram,</p>
<p class="poem">the pilgrim garb for pilgrimage into the new creation.</p>
<p class="poem">Isa himself is the object (mahajja) of our pilgrimage,</p>
<p class="poem">as he said, "I am the right way, the Straight path,</p>
<p class="poem">the mahajja as-sawab."</p>
                    <p class="poem">He lives in the House of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
</p>
<p class="poem">not made by human hands but by the Spirit of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
</p>
<p class="poem">through whom He makes a new creation</p>
<p class="poem">out of all true believers (mu'minin).</p>
<p class="poem">We must discern his body, the house of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
</p>
<p class="poem">wherein dwells his spiritual presence,</p>
<p class="poem">and we must discern him,</p>
<p class="poem">when we relate to fellow believers.</p>
                    <p class="poem">We are starting on a pilgrimage</p>
<p class="poem">and our sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   represents its beginning.</p>
<p class="poem">The Word of <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
   requires this of us</p>
<p class="poem">as our first act of obedience.</p>
<p class="poem">So how can we begin the pilgrimage,</p>
<p class="poem">if we have not obeyed even the first commandment?</p>
<p class="poem">You have heard the saying:</p>
<p class="poem">"My Lord hath commanded Justice (qist)</p>
<p class="poem">and that ye set your whole selves to Him."<a class="note" href="notes.html#N254">254</a></p>
<p class="poem">You have also heard the saying:</p>
<p class="poem">God has bestowed on the children of Adam</p>
<p class="poem">"a raiment of righteousness"</p>
<p class="poem">to cover their shame.<a class="note" href="notes.html#N255">255</a></p>
<p class="poem">Since God's justice (qist) demands</p>
<p class="poem">that the guilty not go unpunished<a class="note" href="notes.html#N256">256</a></p>
<p class="poem">and since his mercy</p>
<p class="poem">has given us a means of covering our shame,</p>
<p class="poem">we who are Khalq Jadeed (New Creation) Muslims</p>
<p class="poem">put on Isa himself as our raiment of righteousness</p>
<p class="poem">when we rise out of the water</p>
<p class="poem">to begin our pilgrimage,</p>
<p class="poem">a journey on which we are being transformed</p>
<p class="poem">into his likeness</p>
<p class="poem">with ever-increasing glory</p>
<p class="poem">which comes from the Lord,</p>
<p class="poem">who is the Spirit. <a class="note" href="notes.html#N257">257</a></p>
                    <p class="poem">It says in the Qur'an</p>
<p class="poem">that "the pagans are unclean"<a class="note" href="notes.html#N258">258</a></p>
<p class="poem">but it takes more than religion or water ablutions</p>
<p class="poem">to make one truly Muslim.</p>
<p class="poem">For many who say they are Muslim</p>
<p class="poem">are pagans at heart,</p>
<p class="poem">and appear clean on the outside of the cup</p>
<p class="poem">but inside are filled with every kind of hypocrisy.</p>
<p class="poem">Only the inner tahara of the new birth</p>
<p class="poem">can remove the inner pagan uncleanness</p>
<p class="poem">and make one a spiritual submitter (Muslim) within.</p>
<p class="poem">Isa says that wherever two or more are</p>
<p class="poem">gathered in his name,</p>
<p class="poem">there He is in the midst of them</p>
<p class="poem">for koinonia or spiritual converse.</p>
<p class="poem">The word for this, most Muslims hear all the time</p>
<p class="poem">but do not understand it.</p>
<p class="poem">Near Mount Sinai, Moses drew near to God</p>
<p class="poem">for spiritual converse (najiy). <a class="note" href="notes.html#N259">259</a></p>
<p class="poem">Unfortunately, this is a word that is not widely  understood.</p>
<p class="poem">It carries the idea</p>
<p class="poem">of communication or connection (ittisaal).</p>
<p class="poem">When we have spiritual converse or koinonia,</p>
<p class="poem">we have ittisaal.</p>
<p class="poem">We are in connection for communication with <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  .</p>
<p class="poem">At the upper room during the Last Supper</p>
<p class="poem">Judas ate bread with the rest,</p>
<p class="poem">but it was not changed in his wicked mouth.</p>
<p class="poem">Nor is there any power in the water of sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
</p>
<p class="poem">or in the bread of the New Creation Id ul-Adha.</p>
<p class="poem">The power is in the ittisaal, in the najiy,</p>
<p class="poem">in the koinonia, in the spiritual converse,</p>
<p class="poem">in the connection, in the communication with <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
 
  .</p>
<p class="poem">There is another meaning in this word.</p>
<p class="poem">It has to do with fellowship or comradeship (zamala).</p>
<p class="poem">Believers experience the zamala in the comradeship</p>
<p class="poem">of being partakers and partners in the grace</p>
<p class="poem">of the Good News.</p>
<p class="poem">It is a comradeship in the Spirit.</p>
<p class="poem">Now, men in an army</p>
<p class="poem">know what esprit de corps ('asabiya) is,</p>
<p class="poem">and in any organization or group,</p>
<p class="poem">religious or otherwise,</p>
<p class="poem">such a feeling of team spirit is not unheard of.</p>
<p class="poem">However, zamala (comradeship) in the Eternal Spirit</p>
<p class="poem">is a comradeship with the Word of God himself.</p>
<p class="poem">It means experiencing his sufferings and his joys</p>
<p class="poem">and his vision and his victories with him.</p>
<p class="poem">Judas experienced the bread of the Lord's feast (id)</p>
<p class="poem">and the water of the sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
</p>
<p class="poem">but he did not experience the zamala.</p>
<p class="poem">Judas experienced the water of sibghat <span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">
تيتراغراماتون</span>
</p>
<p class="poem">as did all the other disciples (hawari)</p>
<p class="poem">but he did not experience zamala.</p>
                    <p class="poem">Here we are talking about a spiritual knowledge.</p>
<p class="poem">Koinonia is not fiqh, the exercise of the intelligence</p>
<p class="poem">or the legal mind.</p>
<p class="poem">It is not 'arif, that so-called knowledge</p>
<p class="poem">of the mystical knower</p>
<p class="poem">who thinks he apprehends God</p>
<p class="poem">by immediate experience and vision</p>
<p class="poem">but without the new birth of regeneration through Isa.</p>
<p class="poem">Koinonia is the knowledge ('ilm) of regeneration (nahda)</p>
<p class="poem">known only by the new creation children of God</p>
<p class="poem">who cry "Abba, Father!" in the power of the  Eternal Spirit</p>
<p class="poem">and know God with a new intimacy through His Word Isa</p>
<p class="poem">not possible without the new birth.</p>
