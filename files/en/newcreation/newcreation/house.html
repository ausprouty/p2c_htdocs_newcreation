	<h1 class = "title">HOW TO START A HOUSE MASJID AND A MESSIANIC MADRASA FOR NEW CREATION MUSLIMS</h1>
	<p class="text">Imagine, if you will, an ordinary house in a secluded 
	 place at the edge of town. It is Thursday and the week-end is 
	 fast approaching. The urgent question is, how can this house be 
	 transformed into a house masjid for the weekend new creation 
	 Muslim fellowship meeting?</p>

	<p class="text">Imagine walking through the front door. On your right is a 
	 bathroom, a perfect place for the believers to wash as Isa did in the Upper Room, 
	 perhaps, after they take off their shoes.</p>

	<p class="text">Some shelves or racks in this area would be helpful, for the 
	 believers to put coats and shoes and other belongings aside in an 
	 orderly way, donning worship attire.</p>

	<p class="text">As you walk into the front room, you notice two things: there is 
	 a distinct lack of western furniture and there are no images of 
	 any kind on the walls. The floor is totally covered with Oriental 
	 carpets, and there are floor cushions and pillows bordering the 
	 walls, but no tables and chairs. On the walls, instead of 
	 pictures of any kind, there are various poster designs utilizing 
	 Arabic calligraphy and quoting key messianic passages  
	 such as are emphasized in this book <a class = "note" href = "#N8">8</a>.</p>

	<p class="text">This is the front room. It can serve as a social hall as 
	 believers are gathering before the main meetings. It can become a 
	 dining room by setting up low, portable tables in a horseshoe 
	 configuration, with the guests sitting on the floor, being served 
	 Muslim-style ethnic foods and tea in small Middle Eastern tea 
	 cups and saucers, etc. Or the low portable dining tables can be 
	 taken out, and the room's floorspace is now cleared again for the 
	 &quot;afterglow&quot; time of spiritual worship to the accompaniment of Middle 
	 Eastern drum, cymbals, etc.</p>

	<p class="text">A second large room in the house could be similarly furnished and 
	 decorated for use both as a place of teaching/preaching and 
	 prayer. The Messianic imam or sheikh could preach or teach from a 
	 seated position (possibly on a floor cushion in a 
	 Mecca-directioned corner of the room) with the believers sitting 
	 on the floor and the Arabic Bible Scriptures opened toward them on a 
	 low book stand. The women could sit together on one side of the 
	 room and the men could sit on the other side, so that the 
	 women are not distracting their line of vision. The women 
	 could wear head scarfs and modest, non-alluring clothing,and the 
	 men could (not required) wear the white prayer hat (koofi).&nbsp; The call to prayer 
	 could be made at the hall doorway leading out of the prayer room 
	 into the fellowship room.</p>

	<p class="text">A possible order of service for a week-end evening meeting 
	 could go something like this.&nbsp; The believers arrive, removing 
	 coats and shoes. After a time of informal 
	 social fellowship, the believers assemble in a prayer circle and 
	 chant their confession.&nbsp; The confession is given in English and 
	 Arabic in the section entitled,&nbsp; The Prayer Life of a New Creation 
	 Muslim (Book 3 above). The confession states:</p>

	 <p class="poem">&quot;I bear witness that Isa is the Word of God, </p>
	 <p class="poem">who sendeth forth the (Eternal) Spirit, </p>
	 <p class="poem">proceeding from the command (Amr) of my Lord, </p>
	 <p class="poem">Isa the Messiah, His Word, </p>
	 <p class="poem">the ransom of all Ibrahim's heirs and our momentous sacrifice, </p>
	 <p class="poem">raised to <span lang="AR-SA"  dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span>, as a warning of the Day of Meeting, </p>
	 <p class="poem">that He might put away our evil-prone flesh, </p>
	 <p class="poem">and bring a new creation, even righteousness by faith alone.&quot; </p>
	

	<p class="text">All these phrases are found in the Qur'an and can be set to 
	 an Islamic style melody by anyone who is musically inclined. 
	 Then the believers could break out of the prayer circle and 
	 could file into the prayer room for a time of Scripture teaching 
	 and prayer. A sample service is provided in the section entitled, 
	 The Prayer Life of a New Creation Muslim (Book 3 above).
	 </p>
	<p class="text">After the teaching and prayer service are concluded, the 
	 believers can go into the fellowship hall and have a common meal 
	 together. Those who break bread together during the 'Idul-'Adha 
	 of Isa portion of the meal can witness to the unbelievers 
	 present. (A large bathtub or other facility somewhere in the 
	 house can be used for the sibghat 
	<span lang="AR-SA" dir="rtl">تيتراغراماتون</span> ceremony whenever it is 
	 deemed advisable to cautiously proceed with it, possibly in 
	 private.) It is assumed, of course, that no unbeliever would be 
	 brought to this type of meeting unless he or she had been 
	 thoroughly screened and was considered a &quot;safe&quot;guest, who would 
	 not go out and make trouble, serving as an infiltrator for a 
	 persecuting agency or individual or family.</p>

	<p class="text">After the fellowship meal is concluded and tea has been served, 
	 the tables can be put away. </p>

	<p class="text">It is our prayer (as well as a 
	 number of other cross-cultural ministers to Muslims who helped in 
	 the development of this book) that those who read these pages 
	 will be encouraged to form house masjid fellowships, perhaps 
	 initially on a once-a-month-basis, but then, later on, on a 
	 weekly or more frequent basis. It is also our prayer that each 
	 house masjid will eventually have its own Messianic Islamic 
	 Academy (Madrassa) for New Creation Muslims so that leaders can 
	 be trained and sent out to start new house masjids in other areas 
	 throughout the world. Then we believe a Muslim people movement to 
	 Isa will begin, and New Creation Muslim communities will spring 
	 up all over the world with their own international congresses, 
	 youth conferences, schools, and special purpose organizations. 
	 Every time a regional conference raises up people burdened and 
	 equipped to plant new worshiping communities, a greater and 
	 greater international network will grow as the world-wide people 
	 movement catches fire.</p>

	<p class="text">The contextualized approach presented in this book,though by no 
	 means the only acceptable Scriptural model, holds great promise 
	 for encouraging an end-time world-wide people movement among the 
	 over one billion Muslims of the world, one quarter of the planet's population, 
	 into the New Creation Ummah of Ibrahim in these last days.</p>
