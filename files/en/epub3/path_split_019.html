</p><p id="N20" class="note1"><span class="note_number">20</span> Qur'an 5:116 is against the worship of Mary, which 
Epiphanius tells us the Collyridians practiced in  Arabia.  Sura 
5:77/73 and similar references are against tritheism  --belief in 
three gods--a doctrine true believers have always  rejected. God 
is one, but He has always had personal distinctions  within 
Himself that included His Word and His Eternal Holy  Spirit.  See 
Sura 4:171 for a reference to "His Word" Isa or  Jesus and see 
5:110 for a reference to His Holy Spirit.  <a class="return" href="path_split_006.html#R20"> ( Return ) </a>
</p><p id="N21" class="note1"><span class="note_number">21</span> This teaching cannot be overemphasized.  The  terms "Father" 
and "Son" are human analogies or metaphors to  give some 
understanding of God as He relates personally to His Word  and as 
His Word relates personally to Him. These terms do not  indicate 
polytheism as the daughters of God did in Sura  53:19-21.  In Sura 
9:30, the title "Son of God" is objected to  because it is seen as 
reflecting the earlier polytheism too.  Nor should  the title 
imply physical paternity, a concept opposed by Sura  6:101.  The 
word "Father" is metaphorical as in the Arabic  name Abu' 
l-Barakat, the Father of Blessings.  Likewise the  word "Son" is 
metaphorical in the Quranic designation Ibn al-Sabil,  "son of the 
road," hence traveler.  Sura 2:215  <a class="return" href="path_split_006.html#R21"> ( Return ) </a>
</p><p id="N22" class="note1"><span class="note_number">22</span> No true prophet before Isa ever claimed to know God,  just to 
have heard from Him or caught a glimpse of Him. In  Matthew 11:27 
Isa claims what only the personal Word of God can claim:  fullness 
of knowledge of God.  This is significant to readers  of the 
Qur'an, since nowhere in the Qur'an does it say that the  Injil 
has a faulty text.  <a class="return" href="path_split_008.html#R22"> ( Return ) </a>

was given the divine authority to judge the whole world  and 
yet the figure in the vision looked like a human  being.  Isa used 
the term "Son of Man" as a description of  himself. It  was his 
favorite messianic title. The 1947 discovery of the two  thousand 
year old Dead Sea Scrolls contains several passages from 
Daniel. These passages are scientific proof that Daniel's  prophecy 
was not lost in erroneous scribal transcription and that  our 
copies of this prophecy are reliable.  <a class="return" href="path_split_008.html#R25"> ( Return ) </a>

</p><p id="N34" class="note1"><span class="note_number">34</span> Ranks 37:107. Some may say that this verse is being  quoted 
out of context, since it originally referred to Ibrahim,  his son, 
and the ram.  However, Isa himself said that  "these same 
Scriptures--meaning the Torah accounts including this  story about 
Abraham--refer to me."(John 5:39) Everything written  about him 
(Isa) in the Law of Moses had to be fulfilled, according  to Isa's 
own words in Luke 24:44. The interpretation of the  Messiah 
himself was that Noah, Joseph, and Ibrahim's son, etc.  are all 
properly interpreted to be prophetic foreshadowings of Isa. 
Therefore, if the Qur'an refers to stories or characters 
in the Law of Moses, then since the original context in  the 
Taurat refers prophetically to Isa, it is arbitrary and  wrong to 
exclude this meaning from the Qur'an.  A true  prophet does not go 
beyond what is written (I Corinthians 4:6). If Isa is  present in 
the original Biblical context, Isa cannot be erased in  any 
subsequent reference to that context, whether in the  Qur'an or 
elsewhere.  Notice that in this Qur'anic reference  we are talking 
about a substitutionary sacrifice.  Qur'anic  commentators who 
disagree can be dismissed because they are not prophets  and their 
comments do not carry prophetic authority. This is true  also of 
their Qur'anic interpretation that says Isa did not die.  <a class="return" href="path_split_009.html#R34"> ( Return ) </a>

over the demonic principalities and powers because of the 
victory He won on the cross as the Word of God. For he  provided a 
death for us that takes away Satan's power over us, the  fear of 
death resulting from sin.  But though sin and death  caught us in 
a Devilish cycle, righteousness and life come to us  through faith 
in the Word of God and His death and resurrection for our 
salvation. See Hebrews 2:14-15; James 1: 14-15;  Colossians 2:15;
