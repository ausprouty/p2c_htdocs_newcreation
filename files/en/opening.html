    <h3>The Quran tells us the importance of seeking the Straight Path:</h3>

    <p ><span class="green">“In the name of God, the Almighty, the Most Merciful. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds. The Almighty, the Most Merciful. Possessor of the Day of Judgment. You alone we serve, and You alone we seek for help. Guide us to the straight path. The path of those whom You have blessed, not those who have incurred the wrath, nor the misguided.”</span> (Surah Al-Fatiha 1, 1-7)</p>


  <p>This is a message that God, the Almighty, the Most Merciful, has repeated many times through his messengers the prophets:</p>

  <p class = "indent">The Prophet Sulaimān exhorted us to <span class="green">“Trust in God with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make straight your paths.”</span></p>

  <span class = "indent">The prophet Dāwūd reminded us that  <span class="green">“God’s word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.”</span></p>

  <p>Are you watching the path of your feet? If so, there is a divine promise.  It is the promise of a Straight Path provided for you. There is a straight path. But also there are very few who find it.</p>

  <p>There was once a man who was given a supernatural directive: get up and go to the street called Straight, and inquire at a certain house for a holy man who is praying.  This man obeyed and found the Straight Path and changed the world!</p>
